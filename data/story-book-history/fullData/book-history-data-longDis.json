We will focus on developing skills in close reading, while using this monumental work to survey the flourishing cultural landscape of early modern China. Our discussions will situate the novel alongside recent scholarship on gender and sexuality, material culture, and performance.

Unlike other introductory or survey courses, this seminar introduces you to literary studies and related art forms (film, fine arts, music, science, etc.) through the practice of slow reading. We typically dedicate two weeks to one author whose work we explore more carefully (reading a book in its entirety, not samples), by couching it in an interdisciplinary context. This means that we will read fewer pages per week, but we will study them in a more focused way. Slowing down our reading pace will allow us to appreciate more deeply how writers and artists created and understood the world around them and why they still inspire and transform us today. It will allow us to engage in-depth with the specific media and means they use(d) to create their works (style, genre, etc.). Some recurring topics that will accompany us throughout the semester include the environment, the importance and variety of nature, migration, and gender. Through close reading of carefully selected works, accompanied by major critical and theoretical statements, we will sharpen our interpretive skills and engage with literary, visual, and aural texts from the past two millennia as we’ll explore the relation of literature to topics as diverse as the rise of new media, technological transformation and its relation to the humanities, the human/non-human divide, medicine, sexuality, translation, space, race, ecology, violence, and (post-)colonialism. Film screenings and visits to the Houghton Library, Harvard Museum of Natural History, and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston are an important part of the course.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

No book in the history of Western culture has been read more intensively that the Bible, and the main emphasis of the course will fall on close readings of major ancient Jewish and Christian interpreters of the Bible, with a view to considering their exegetical approaches historically as well as through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory. We will also consider how the respective religious and theological beliefs of these interpreters shaped <em>and</em> were shaped by the ways they read Scripture. As a consequence, this will also be a course about the early development of Judaism and Christianity although the focus will always be on the interpretation of the bible. All readings will be in English translation, and will include Dead Sea Scrolls selections, Philo, Rabbinic Midrash and Medieval Jewish Commentaries, the New Testament, Origen and other early Christian commentators, Augustine, Luther, and as a concluding coda, Spinoza. The course is open to both undergraduates and graduate students; there will be extra sessions for the graduate students.</p>",

We will try initially  to establish a taxonomy of landscape writing, to mark the outlines of the  genre and enable us to select specific types of writing on which to  concentrate. Then we will look closely at criticism, both as a practice that  operates across the genres of landscape writing and as a significant  technique in teaching and professional life. Various modes of  criticism--formalist, political, feminist, ecological--will be examined as  they pertain to landscape. The course will then pursue two objectives  simultaneously: analysis of significant texts, especially on exemplary works  of landscape architecture; and composition of both short and long essays,  perhaps including a critique of a built or proposed project; a book review;  or a site history/project proposal such as students might be asked to prepare  in studio or in practice.   The course will meet in discussion sessions; students will also meet  individually on a regular basis with the instructor to edit their writings.  The goal of the course is to assist students in developing the interpretive  and writing skills useful in professional life. Each student will be  expected to submit a final paper of publishable quality. The course is  intended as a complement to GSD 9206; the  two courses will meet at the same time on alternating weeks.

The more recent rubric of \"Design\" has tended to ignore the differences between these fields, while historians and critics have exaggerated their disparities in the search of defining areas of academic study. This course will study the vicissitudes of each discipline simultaneously as a means of analyzing how the consumption of objects in modern society has come to materialize, anticipate or resist societal changes in Europe and America.   The course will thrive on the contradictions and coincidences between theory and practice. \"Designer\" movements and stylistic fashions will be tested against cultural, economic and political trends. We will study specific manufacturing techniques and technological developments together with their impact on social ideals. In addition, the course will use marketing and advertising as a means of understanding how objects were conceived, manufactured and ultimately grouped in space.   <b>Methodology </b>  The semester is divided into three parts: The first four weeks we will deal with issues that came to the forefront before World War II. The second group of lectures will look at themes, spaces and/or groups of objects across the twentieth century. And in the final four weeks we will concentrate on subjects that dominate the second half of the twentieth century as well as current design thinking. However, the chronological boundaries between topics will be not strictly defined, and most lectures will expand beyond the confines of a particular period.   Most weeks will be divided into two halves (Tuesday and Thursday). The core lecture will be given during the first class meeting; on some occasions the second class will be dedicated to outside lecturers or student presentations.   <b>Student Workload</b>  Students are expected to submit a final twenty-page paper (min.) on a topic of their choice. A list of topics will be provided to aid students on their selections. In addition, students are expected to make a five-minute Power Point presentation on their paper topic during one of the assigned presentation sessions. Please note that while the papers are due on January 15th, thesis students are expected to turn in their papers on December 12th. Thesis students who wish to turn their papers in at an earlier or later date should see me (deadline for thesis students is negotiable as long as it is dealt with in advance).  Due to the slim requirements for the course, attendance is mandatory and will be taken into consideration at the time of grading.   <b>Bibliography</b>  The following books are available at the coop for purchasing: The Theory of Decorative Art, Isabelle Frank Ed. (Yale University Press, 2000)  Twentieth Century Design, Jonathan M. Woodham (Oxford University Press,1997)  Objects of Desire, Adrian Forty (Thames and Hudson, 2000)  All additional material recommended or required for reading will be available at the reserve desk at least a week in advance of each lecture.  After each lecture I will provide a list of readings, which I encourage students to complete in preparation for the next lecture. The reading list is divided into three categories: \"Must\", \"Recommended\" and \"Only for the hard core.\" The \"must\" category encompasses materials without which the meaning of the lecture might be lost, so you MUST read them before class. These tend to be short and to the point. \"Only for the hard core\" will include an essay that substantially expands on a topic covered in class. The \"recommended\" category usually includes topics covered during the lecture, and thus is only intended as additional information and/or refresher and/or different point of reference. Students are only expected to read the \"must\" catego</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>What do designers of the built environment see as environment? This is a particularly difficult question at the turn of a century that has witnessed the intersection of two \"crises\" - the crisis of environment and the crisis of representation. The former is evidenced in the littany of problems that confront us today through the media, in conversations, and in everyday life - problems such as pollution, ozone depletion, energy shortage, species loss, etc. The crisis of representation, on the other hand, is evidenced in the lack of agreement on the definition of an environmental problem or, perhaps more accurately, the multiplicity of readings of a problem's context. It is not uncommon today to see a definition of the context deny the problem all together. In such a contentious milieu, how does one situate oneself as a designer engaged in the making of environments?  This class introduces students to a range of writings on an idea that lies, often concealed in its particularity, behind presentations and discussions of environmental concerns, viz., nature. We will explore this idea at work in the arguments and manifestos of individuals, movements, and organizations. How does nature shape argument, how does it shape environment, and how does it influence design?  The class is structured around the following conflicts:  Wildness and Wilderness Preservation and Conservation Word and Action City and Region Region &amp; Metropolis Community &amp; Resistance Edge &amp; Surface Nature and Culture  First Nature &amp; Second Nature Land &amp; Landscape Environment and Development Nature &amp; Technology Ecology &amp; Economics Planet Earth and Local Commons Economic Resource &amp; Vernacular Use Globe &amp; Cosmos Machine and Organism Part &amp; Whole Individual &amp; Field Material &amp; Agency  Each conflict has a history which we will unfold. Each conflict also calls into play different disciplines: ecology, environmental ethics, politics, social justice, economics, literary criticism, planning and environmental philosophy. We will discuss the precepts of these disciplines in parallel so as to better follow arguments and position ourselves in this extremely diverse and contentious field of growing importance.  A course reader will be made available. Students are expected to do the readings prior to the class. 25% of the grade will be reserved for class participation. The remaining 75% is for three short papers (5 pages each, double-spaced) on any three of the conflicts. They could be critical assessments of arguments, applications to a site, or reflections on a design concern.

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>What do three contemporary tropes ubiquitous in recent architecture have in common: 1) complex and varied aggregations, 2) the migration of informal domestic atmospheres into public and institutional spaces, and 3) topographical forms?  &nbsp;  The thesis of this seminar will be that each of these formal trends is rooted in conditions anatomized in recent political theory. Such signal texts as Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt’s <i>Multitude</i> and Paolo Virno’s <i>A Grammar of the Multitude</i> articulate a new view of social and political relationships within which atomized individuals can no longer recognize themselves in collective social forms. This social and political transformation is lent a name by Peter Sloterdijk in his essays—<i>Foam City</i>—in which he describes the space of multidinous individuals as figureless, multi-chambered foam.   &nbsp;  The conditions described in these texts pose a difficult paradox for architecture. Because, for subjects of this “multitude” “. . . anything labeled as public has become irredeemably tainted, everything that smacks of the institution arouses distaste and repels in a subliminal, well-nigh Pavlovian fashion. . . “ (Frederic Jameson) and yet all that architects build are such institutions of collective life.   &nbsp;  Terms like the more recent “mass-customization”, or older “weak-architecture,” and “field condition” have all proposed strategies with which to overcome an antinomy that is not to be vanquished: the simultaneous rise of ever increasing scales of organization with ever increasing demands of individual autonomy. It will be the goal of this seminar to explore through texts and examples the ways in which this antinomy has spawned architecture’s contemporary forms.   &nbsp;  The formal tropes which will be the focus of the seminar are divided, into three categories (as mentioned above).   &nbsp;  Thus, informal aggregations, found in such projects as NL Architects’ Taipei Performing Arts Centre, Herzog + DeMeuron’s 56 Leonard St. condo tower, and MVRDV’s Lego City will be considered in relationship to the vernacular inspired experiments of Aldo van Ecyk, Herman Hertzberger, and Moshe Safdie. Bernard Rudofsky’s exhibition and book, <i>Architecture without Architects</i>, will be an important point of reference. Contemporary texts and historical considerations will reveal the subtle, but finally fundamental shifts in attitude undergirding formally similar strategies of aggregative expression. Both past and contemporary bodies of work will be considered against the backdrop of the socially and politically distinct commitments of Fordist repetition of pre-WWII Modernism.  &nbsp;  The open-field and topographical forms of the present in such works as FOA’s International Ferry Terminal, UN Studio’s Genoa Port project, and OMA’s Jussieu Library will be considered in relationship to the vicissitudes of the picturesque in Modernist architectural work and the codification of the picturesque in its original theoretical articulations.  &nbsp;  The migration of informal, domestic, and private atmospheres into public spaces, such as found in Office dA’s Fleet Library at RISD, and in the sofa-like seating in the principle concert hall of OMA’s Casa da Musica will be considered as part of an longer trajectory that has sought to dismantle the distinction between private and public norms in which the former trumps the latter.  &nbsp;  The historical treatment of these themes will reveal similarities of form that sometimes hide profound differences in the meanings attached to them, even while uncovering antecedents to the present. Each formal history will be accompanied by readings both texts in both political theory and architectural history.  &nbsp;</p>",

The verse may serve as a doubly apt epigraph for a seminar devoted to the past, present, and future of the library as an institution. Apt because the first half has ornamented many a façade of a European library over the course of the past five centuries. Apt also because we live in an age in which digital forms of communication and media are quite literally exploding the prior culture of memory, with the demise of the printed book and the traditional library now a frequent topic of discussion.  What form should the library of the 21st century assume? Should it simply vanish into virtual desktops and merge into a timeless and placeless universal database? Should it adopt a double identity, bridging the worlds of print and digital documents, of physical presence and telepresence? Should it alter its identity and become a workshop, a laboratory, an innovation incubator where emerging and future forms interact and dialogue with the relics of the past? Or should it simply merge with the university itself as a place of knowledge production and reproduction? If so, where then should books \"go\" in the 21st century? And how about all the other \"old media\" that make up the record of human civilizations?  Informed answers to such questions require an understanding of libraries themselves, the practices that have shaped them, their systems of access, retrieval, and storage. For libraries are not just collections of documents and books, but also physical structures and, for that matter, infrastructures. Indeed, libraries are among the most venerable of building types, dating back to the ancient Near East. Their history is also that of cataloguing systems, vault and case designs, carrels and desks, viewing devices, lecterns, and the like.  <b>Bibliotheca</b> combines exploration of the history of the library as an institution of knowledge storage, retrieval and production with a design studio concerned with problem sets involving libraries on the Harvard campus as well as questions the future shape and functions of the library as an institution. The seminar is divided into three sections: the first is devoted to the history of libraries and library infrastructures; the second to case studies of major contemporary library projects; the third to brainstorming about design solutions to the real-world problems being confronted by the Harvard libraries.  Topics will include: libraries in the cultural imagination, library infrastructures from registers to card catalogues to digital catalogues, the history of shelving systems and lecterns, library architectures from the Library of Alexandria to the Digital Public Library of America.  </p>",

Why and whence this obsession with Now?&nbsp; What kinds of temporal lags or leaps does fiction afford us? How are questions of&nbsp;<em>identity&nbsp;</em>knitted to our histories, present circumstances, and hopes for the future?&nbsp;&nbsp;Works include:&nbsp;Tony Tulathimutte's&nbsp;<em>Private Citizens&nbsp;</em>(2016),&nbsp;Ben Lerner’s&nbsp;<em>10:04&nbsp;</em>(2015), N.K.

But even before we get all the way back to the Big Bang, there must have been a time when stars like our Sun or galaxies like our own Milky Way did not exist because the Universe was denser than they are. We therefore face the important question about our origins: how and when did the first stars and galaxies form? Primitive versions of this question were considered by humans in religious and philosophical texts for thousands of years, long before it was realized that the Universe expands. The Seminar will summarize the fundamental principles and scientific ideas that are being used to address this question in modern cosmology. Previous generations of scholars have also wondered about the long-term future of the Universe. For the first time in history, we now have a standard cosmological model that agrees with a large body of data about the past history of the Universe. The Seminar will conclude with the forecast that this scientific model makes about our future. The Seminar will be based on a book with the same title written by Professor Loeb (Princeton University Press, 2010).</p>",

Christians not only owned slaves, but they also argued that slavery was sanctioned by the Bible. This seminar will explore the relationship between Christianity and slavery in America from 1619, when the first slaves arrived in Virginia, to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. We will ask several questions. What was the role of Christianity in sanctioning slavery? How did white Christians become convinced that slavery was sinful? Why did many slaves convert to Christianity, the religion of their oppressors? How did enslaved Christians make sense of their suffering? The main work of the seminar will involve curating an exhibit on Christianity and slavery in America at the Andover-Harvard Theological Library. With the help of library staff, we will choose documents and objects for the exhibit, write captions, and organize the exhibit cases. The exhibit will open in early December and will remain on display for the rest of the academic year. Class meetings will take place each week in the Special Collections department of Andover-Harvard Theological Library, where we will read and discuss rare books and manuscripts, including proslavery tracts and sermons, abolitionist speeches, poems, and the personal religious narratives of enslaved men and women.</p>",

In our seminar we will study poems from different times and regions, with a special emphasis on the twentieth-century European and American experimental literature. We will discuss visual poetry from Ancient Greece and Renaissance England, poems about paintings by Rilke and Auden, avant-garde texts and performances of Futurist and Dadaist artists, postwar French sound poetry, international concrete poetry movement, contemporary artists’ books, as well as recordings and readings of major poets. We will look for poetry in Harvard Art Museums and listen to recordings in the Woodberry Poetry Room. We will examine artists’ books from Harvard libraries, attend a poetry reading in Cambridge, view electronic archives of poetry, analyze voices of poets performing their texts, and study poems which are barely legible. We will confront these poetic experiments with scholarly texts from such disciplines as sound studies, art history, acoustic phonetics, graphic design, and literary studies. Finally, we will ask what are the gains and challenges of using innovative techniques and technologies in poetry and art.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>The first 1/3 of course will include close readings, video tours and on-foot excursions around 17th and 18th 19th century Harvard Square as we read Ann Bradstreet, Edward Taylor,&nbsp; Michael Wigglesworth,&nbsp; Phillis Wheatley, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Maria White Lowell and Ralph Waldo Emerson . In this part of the course we will practice a range of approaches to reading poems, considering a poem’s form alongside its cultural function, surveying the diverse and changing media and formats in which poems circulate--manuscript, performance, print, aural recording, performance;&nbsp; individual volume,&nbsp; general circulation magazine or newspaper,&nbsp; literary quarterly,&nbsp; schoolbook, gift book, psalter and more.&nbsp; Excursions may include visits to First Parish or Memorial Church, to Mt Auburn Cemetery and the Washington’s Headquarters and the Longfellow House. In the second 2/3 of the course we will focus on 20th century Harvard and its writers , with particular attention to 4 Harvard inflected moments in American literary history—the emergence of Modernism (&nbsp; with attention to Robinson, Du Bois, Frost,&nbsp; Reed,&nbsp; Stevens, Cullen); the rise of the&nbsp; New Criticism in the 1950’s&nbsp; (its standard bearers Eliot and Lowell ); the critique of New Criticism and rise of counter movements, New York School, Black Mountain, Beat Language,&nbsp; L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (from O’Hara, Ashbery, Koch, Creeley to Hejinian, Bernstein, Howe ) ; and, finally, Harvard and Radcliffe’s role in fostering poets from Gertrude Stein, Elizabeth Bishop&nbsp; through June Jordan and Adrienne Rich. Our 20th century studies will take us to the Woodberry Poetry Room, to Houghton and Schlesinger libraries, and students in the seminar will make their own contribution to Harvard's long poetic tradition by filming individual and group readings and interpretations of American poems for inclusion in the Poetry in America MOOC and other online outlets.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>What do imagined animals have to teach human readers? Why, when literary writers think about hunger, violence, sex, suffering, technology, expressivity, the gods, and education (for example), do they so often draw upon animal behavior to understand human practice? The representation of animals in literature tends to range from the cute to the terrifying, with the beautiful in between: animals are cute when they act like us, beautiful when they express desire, but often terrifying when we realize that we act like them. Cute representation of animals tends to characterize children’s literature, while the beautiful and the terrifying material is on the whole reserved for the grown-ups (though those boundary lines are by no means uncrossed). Cute animals tend to be small, the beautiful mid-size, and terrifying huge. Either way—cute, beautiful or terrifying—we need animals to think, no doubt because we are ourselves animals, even if we often pretend not to be. Our habitual ways of looking to animals in order to think about ourselves almost always deploy analogy and/or metaphor; the thought experiment sometimes takes the form of having animals actually cross species lines (animals becoming human, or, more commonly, vice versa). This seminar will focus on extraordinarily brilliant animal literature (funny, mordant, touching, sophisticated) in great European literature, from the last 2000 years. The seminar will also teach students how to read literature. On many weeks we will explore the book history of our texts, including texts held in the astonishing riches of Harvard Library System holdings. Throughout the seminar we will also make frequent reference to visual images of animals. The class will be entirely open to news from evolutionary biology that students bring to it, but its focus is not on the non-human natural world in and for itself; the focus is, rather, on the way in which humans represent animals in order to understand human behavior.</p>",

In this freshman seminar, we will utilize Houghton’s extraordinary holdings to study first-hand the history of the book in the West as a material artifact from its beginnings in the ancient Near East down to the present day. Each week we will focus upon a cluster of books.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before class, students will be asked to examine selected books in Houghton’s Reading Room as well as online.&nbsp;&nbsp; During class-time, we will study the books again as a group. Visiting experts will demonstrate how to unroll a papyrus codex, the technology involved in creating a codex and printing on a hand-pulled press, and the techniques modern conservators use to preserve manuscripts and books. You will emerge from this seminar with a heightened understanding of what a rich thing a book is, and so much more than just a text. And you will have seen and studied close-up some of the most visually spectacular and culturally significant books in all Western history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",

In this course we will study the history and development of both the seder and the Haggadah-- as a ritual, as a text, and as a physical book. Readings will be drawn from the Bible, Mishnah, the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds, the New Testament and early Christian writers, medieval Haggadah manuscripts and early printed editions, as well as more recent versions of the Haggadah from both Israel and America (including non-traditional haggadot). We will deal extensively with the tradition of Haggadah illustration, and will utilize Harvard’s extensive collection of Haggadot in both Widener and Houghton Library. The focus of the course will be on the reading and analysis of primary sources. No previous experience with Passover is required, but students should have at least two years of Hebrew (Biblical or modern) and be prepared to read texts in Hebrew.

Historical events and movements discussed include the English Reformation and the Act of Supremacy, the development of the Book of Common Prayer, varieties of Puritanism, the “worship wars” of the early seventeenth century, the English Civil War, the Protectorate/Interregnum and the disestablishment of the Church of England, and the Restoration of the Monarchy. We will also explore the “afterlife” of this period, as it was received and interpreted by Anglican theologians of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Students will leave this course with a deeper understanding of the history and literature of this complex period, and an appreciation for how its debates and controversies continue to resonate across the church today.

Students will study a wide range of verbal and visual texts produced over a thousand-year span throughout Europe, including commentaries and histories, sermons and saints' lives, eschatological plays and visionary poetry, illustrated Apocalypse manuscripts and early printed books, and sculpture and stained glass.

In the process, science is presented as monolithic and ahistorical, and religion as equally fixed and unidimensional. This mode of investigation often fails to engage with questions of race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status, and is oblivious to the history of colonialism and to the concerns of indigenous populations. In this course, we deploy a critical lens in understanding and discussing different questions at the intersection of science and religion. Using a series of case studies, and engaging with a number of theoretical and methodological approaches derived from religious studies, history and philosophy of science and STS (Science, Technology and Society studies), postcolonial, critical race and queer theory, the course investigates the production of meanings and the making of intellectual, epistemic and political authority at the intersection of scientific and religious cultures.</p><p>The course is a research workshop with a focus on training and professionalization and an emphasis on methods tools in academic writing and research. Students work on specific projects throughout the semester from topic selection, question formation, to research and writing to produce a piece of academic writing such as research papers, conference papers, articles, book reviews, prospectus, syllabi, etc. Jointly offered in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as History of Science 219.</p>",

Prior to the rise of Western hegemony, North African Arabs have maintained close ties with Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africans through religion, trade, war and diplomacy. This long history is documented by an abundant archive in Arabic language or African language in the Arabic script. Drawing from theories of knowledge and primary sources in Arabic, this seminar introduces participants to a critical study of Islamic intellectual history in Africa. It addresses critically notions like knowledge, higher learning, history, book, author, archive, orality, audiences, memory, discursive space, library, that require an adequate contextualizing to read authors of past centuries and use their writing for the study of social and intellectual history. Participants will examine how knowledge was produced, reproduced and transmitted in Muslim societies of Africa. Reading proficiency in Arabic is a requirement for this course.</p>",

This seminar looks at Walter Gropius and the other Bauhaus architects, such as Mies van der Rohe, who moved to the United States, and examines how successfully their architectural ideas translated into a North American context. It will also look at the impact that they and other leading European modernist architects had on subsequent generations of architects. How might we understand the influence of the modernist masters—such as Mies or Le Corbusier—on contemporary architects, such as Rem Koolhaas? For example, are we to perceive Koolhaas as someone somewhat critical of Le Corbusier, as suggested by his book, Delirious New York, or as someone who modeled himself consciously on Le Corbusier, as suggested by Rene Daalder in his new movie about Koolhaas, Leaning Towers? The course also looks—more generally—at the translation of academic ideas within the field of architecture. How successfully might we translate theoretical “tools” from philosophy and deploy them within the field of architecture in order to “rethink” architectural theory? Or how successfully might we adopt technological tools from other disciplines and embrace them within the field of architecture? Indeed, can architecture itself ever be seen as an autonomous discipline, or will it always feed off theoretical ideas and technological innovations from other disciplines?</p> <p>This seminar course will also include a group study trip to Dessau and Berlin, Germany. The trip will include research visits to the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation and the Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin, and visits to outstanding examples of modernist and contemporary architecture in Dessau and Berlin. The visit will last approximately 9 days, from 27/28 March to 5 April, and will include accommodation in Gropius’s own masterpiece, the Bauhaus in Dessau. The trip will also include a symposium in Dessau on 1 April, and it is hoped that material from that symposium will form part of a publication.</p> <p>Preference in enrollment is given to MDes History of Philosophy of Design and PhD students. The trip is limited to 12 students. </p> <p>Note, students selected for 3362 in the online limited enrollment lottery and opt to travel will be term billed $300, in addition to the costs of meals and incidentals. Students are responsible for obtaining the necessary visas. One set itinerary is made for the trip with no modifications. If students wish to modify the itinerary, it may be possible for them to do so in direct contact with the travel agent, and the student is responsible for any change fees incurred. Students will need to sign a travel waiver in the Department of Architecture and register their trip with Harvard Travel Assist.  </p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>Two leading scholars of the architecture of Andrea Palladio, Guido Beltramini and Howard Burns of the Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio, Vicenza, will offer workshops exploring Raphael (1483-1520) and Andrea Palladio (1508-1580), two of the most influential architects of the Renaissance, and the relation between them. Though they had different backgrounds - Palladio trained as a stone carver, whereas Raphael was the&nbsp;son of the court painter in Urbino - they are similar in their view of history, their concern with architectural drawing and representation and commitment to the study and imitation of ancient Roman architecture. Raphael must have been a major source of inspiration for Palladio, who in Rome made a survey plan of his masterpiece, the villa Madama. He also adopted elements of Raphael’s architectural language. He would have noted Raphael’s skill in creating personalized palaces for high functionaries in Pope Leo X’s inner circle.</p><p>&nbsp;The fall session Faking Palladio will introduce students to Palladio’s world,&nbsp;requiring them to produce a fake Palladio drawing. This requires in-depth knowledge of both the material character of the work to be imitated and also the cultural background of the architect imitated. Students will not be invited to produce an exact copy of an existing drawing but to invent a drawing that has never existed. This sort of exercise is made possible because Palladio developed an architecture that he conceived as a language, based on standard elements (such as rooms, stairs, doors, and columns) with proportions governing the relations between the various components. Palladio's treatise, The Four Books on Architecture (Venice, 1570), is essentially a manual with instructions referring to his architecture. Among&nbsp;Palladio’s drawings we find drawings for unbuilt buildings: many of them&nbsp;are plans without the corresponding elevations. To make a fake Palladio drawing, a good starting point is a Palladio original plan from which to imagine a possible development. The students will be asked first to design the elevation, or part of it, then to make a fake, focusing on the materiality of the drawing as an object (the paper, ink, stylus drawn lines, etc.) and on Palladio’s drawing conventions, which are close to those used today.</p><p>This spring session Anticipating Palladio will be dedicated to Raphael, always considered as one of the greatest painters. However, he was also a brilliant and innovative (and still little-known) architect, whose approach anticipates Palladio’s. The spring session will consist of lectures, workshops, and seminars on the buildings to be visited during the trip. Topics to be covered include Raphael’s architectural formation (in Urbino, Perugia, Florence and Rome), his writings and ideas, drawings, painted architecture, buildings and design methods, as well as his social world of friends, collaborators, patrons, and rivals, including Michelangelo. Students will explore the complex relation in Raphael between study of ancient Roman architecture and the design of modern buildings, and his revival of Roman constructional techniques and modes of interior decoration. Unbuilt, unfinished or destroyed works by him will be reconstructed in drawings and models. Raphael will also be approached as a “proto- film director”, creator of marvelous single-shot still “movies.” The seminar will offer an exceptional educational and architectural experience and will have a specific goal and outcome: generating&nbsp;ideas and prototypes for virtual and physical models for the exhibition IN THE MIND OF RAPHAEL, Raphael as Architect and inventor of architecture, to be held at the Palladio Centre in Vicenza (Oct. 2020 – Jan. 2021).</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>“What does it mean to exhibit architecture?”  Exhibitions are an integral part of the history of architecture. While architecture entered the gallery during the Enlightenment, first in London around 1760, and later in Paris and Berlin, a significant step was taken in the early twentieth century when Philip Johnson, meeting Alfred H. Barr Jr., the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, suggested “why not include architecture”; marking the creation of the first collection of architecture within an art museum. &nbsp;In the late 1970s, architecture entered the Venice Biennale a decision that soon gave rise to the multiplication of architecture Biennials and Triennials and other large-scale exhibitions, expanding even further the ‘exhibitionary’ complex within the discipline.  Yet, as it is well known, exhibiting architecture is a paradoxical act of radical deracination. It is difficult not to say impossible to present architecture within the space of the gallery without representing or translating it into simulacra and other forms of representation – into drawings, models, prints, photographs, digital format, films, books and other objects.  This seminar invites students to explore the historical and theoretical conditions but also the political and institutional contexts under which architecture exhibitions are produced and consumed. Looking at exhibiting architecture beyond mere representation and starting from the hypothesis that architects, through the act of “exhibiting”, exert different forms of agency on and beyond the building site, this seminar will explore how exhibitions have been a critical site for exchange and competition, spatial experimentation, research, performance and protest as well as the construction of national identities.  Through a close reading of some of the most seminal texts with regards to the theory and history of exhibiting architecture we will study specific historical and contemporary examples of architecture exhibitions. We will see how during the cold war, cultural exchanges and competitions played out at international exhibitions. We will look at the questions of the curator as an author and creative figure while exploring new ways of displaying narratives (through timelines, dioramas and panoramas) and scrutinize the means and motivations behind architecture’s inclusion into the museum. We will also investigate the rise of “activist” exhibitions and the inclusion of performance as a new means of interacting with the built environment.  Each week, lectures and reading analysis, followed by practical exercises and visits, will allow us to move through different agencies of display. In parallel, students will be asked to produce a curatorial project that will be presented during our last session. The evaluation will be based on student’s active participation to the course (30%) and their final project and presentation (70%).  This course will include the participation of guest lecturers Véronique Patteeuw and Marina Otero Verzier.  Enrolment in this course was pre-selected via early lottery. It is limited to students enrolled in the GSD Rotterdam Study Abroad Program.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>Design is ubiquitous, complex, and all but impossible to define. It affects almost everything that we experience through our senses, and it permeates our lives, both waking and sleeping. Texts, images, objects, environments, minds, and social encounters are all shaped by design, which has a subtle yet definite power that often operates just below the threshold of conscious perception. And yet, design emanates from the conscious mind; in the most capacious sense, it designates, as the Oxford English Dictionary explains, a “plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution; the preliminary conception of an idea that is to be carried into effect by action; a project.” With this definition in mind, you could construct a 500,000-year history of design, beginning with the primitive tools of proto-humans and extending to the open-source code on GitHub. Or you could begin even earlier, say, with God.</p><p>This course takes a more modest historical approach. It tracks the history of design from the Industrial Revolution to the digital revolution in the United States, and it gives sustained attention to the relationship between this history and American literature, broadly conceived. At least since Edgar Allan Poe published his “Philosophy of Furniture” in 1840, American authors have engaged with the objects and ideas of design thinking. Such engagement has taken many different forms since the mid-nineteenth century: simultaneous attraction to and repulsion from the technological, the industrial, and the machine; obsession with the distinctions among art, craft, and decoration; fascination with cities as designed spaces and with literary art as a designed (if not exactly designer) thing; and attention to the poetics of fashion, advertising, shopping, décor, bric-a-brac, trash, and other superficial matters. But engaging with such matters, superficial or otherwise, provokes deep and abiding questions for the literary authors on this syllabus––questions about the relation between economics and politics, about the cultural forces of race, class, gender, and ethnicity, about the status of art and aesthetic experience in a democratic society, and about the very definition of what it means to be human—all of which are highly relevant to us today, as we navigate through an increasingly designed, increasingly virtual world of lived experience.</p><p>N. B. This course may include a “design studio” component featuring book designer Peter Mendelsund. Stay tuned for more information.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>The study of science and religion has been traditionally dominated by theoretical discussions centered around the possibility of reconciling Science (capital S: often referring to Western Science) and Religion (capital R, often referring to specific traditions as understood through Western lens). In the process, science is presented as monolithic and ahistorical, and religion as equally fixed and unidimensional. This mode of investigation often fails to engage with questions of race, gender, sexuality and socioeconomic status, and is oblivious to the history of colonialism and to the concerns of indigenous populations. In this course, we deploy a critical lens in understanding and discussing different questions at the intersection of science and religion. Using a series of case studies, and engaging with a number of theoretical and methodological approaches derived from religious studies, history and philosophy of science and STS (Science, Technology and Society studies), postcolonial, critical race and queer theory, the course investigates the production of meanings and the making of intellectual, epistemic and political authority at the intersection of scientific and religious cultures.</p><p>The course is a research workshop with a focus on training and professionalization and an emphasis on methods tools in academic writing and research.

Instead of the trained skepticism of a police detective, we will apply that of a lawyer to determine the validity of a major piece of contemporary received historical wisdom. The focus of study will be on the prevailing account of the theory of torts developed by Oliver Wendell Holmes.</p>\n<p>According to that account, Holmes emphatically rejected strict liability in favor of the negligence rule on moral and pragmatic grounds; indeed to economically subsidize nascent American industry, he is said to have led the opposition to adopting the expansive English rule of Rylands v. Fletcher.</p>\n<p>Our inquiry will ripen into a genuine whodunit upon discovery that much of the historical record has been hidden and distorted by the contemporary histories of it. To solve this mystery, to figure out the who, how, when and why of it, we will examine the available evidence, some presented in distributed materials, but most derived from archival and more conventional legal and non-legal research. With legal history courses proliferating, and historical arguments exerting increasing influence on judicial decisions, our case study of the history of Holmes's thinking can serve as an object lesson in the well-known but too often neglected rule of good practice: check the sources. In the process, we will explore the nature and historical origins of Holmes's jurisprudence, the intellectual wellspring for today's and in all probability tomorrow's leading thought on the purposes and processes of court-made law.</p>\n<p>During the intervals between meetings, students will conduct research and write memos detailing and analyzing their findings. Class discussions will be devoted to critically evaluating the research reports and analyses and to mapping further lines of investigation.</p>\n<p>My research on this matter is reported in The Hidden Holmes: His Theory of Torts in History (1995). I request that those interested in enrolling not read my book nor any accounts of it, before they are assigned as class readings.</p>\n<p>Beyond a contrarian spirit and enjoyment of treasure hunts, there are no prerequisites for enrolling in the course.</p>",

Third, to gain an historical perspective up to and including a current and sophisticated consensus (i.e., review articles of recent years). Socratic debate will be prioritized in the classroom. The main discipline presented in this course is pharmacology, specifically, in vivo pharmacology and more specifically, behavioral pharmacology in humans. Pharmacology has traditionally been a graduate-level subject and rarely present in undergraduate curricula. That is a shame, because pharmacology has played and continues to play a key role in the history of neuroscience, in many applications of clinical medicine, and in the relationships among \"mind, brain, and behavior.\" Moreover, students with an interest in medical sciences and careers will find extremely useful the tools and concepts of pharmacology, from elucidating mechanisms of action using basic research, to applications in the clinic using analgesic, antipsychotic, anti-Parkinsonian, stimulant, and anesthetic drugs.

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>The scientific study of sleep is both highly interdisciplinary and among the most unifying of topics in psychology and the neurosciences. In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby investigators in human and animal research work together to continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Scientific findings increasingly point to the importance of sleep for mental health and optimum performance, as well as to sleep disruption as both a result and potential cause of mental illness. In psychiatric neuroscience, sleep is an area in which many fundamental questions remain unanswered due to the unique challenges of studying human sleep.</p><p>Despite rapidly accelerating new discoveries and ever-increasing knowledge about the mechanisms and correlates of sleep, much remains controversial. Remarkably, there still is no scientifically agreed upon \"function\" for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives! Why should a behavior as universal as sleep remain mysterious? My great curiosity about sleep is continually stimulated by such questions. By the end of this seminar, I very much hope that students will become similarly fascinated with this enigma that exists right under our noses, and perhaps some may choose to further explore this exciting area of neuroscience.</p><p>Each student will have the opportunity to ponder and form their own opinions on the functions of sleep. While the seminar will emphasize mental health and sleep medicine, my goal is for students to consider our daily alternation in states of consciousness from many perspectives. These might include sleep's roles at the level of genes and their protein products, sleep's manifestation across animal taxa, its possible evolutionary history and present ecology, sleep's influence on brain development, societal influences on sleep, and how and why consciousness should emerge during sleep in the form of dreams.</p><p>Following lectures providing an overview of the behavioral neuroscience of sleep, each student will focus on topic related to sleep and mental health that they will research in depth and present to the class. Such topics might include the characteristic abnormalities of sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum or neurodegenerative disorders. Other topics might include the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric illnesses such as links between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders and bipolar illness, or insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders. Still other topics might include the role of sleep in the trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep - disruption of which might constitute an important pathway to neurodegenerative illnesses.</p><p>Lectures taking place during the first 6-8 classes will cover the basics of sleep behavior, physiology and neuronal control. Subsequent classes will consist of presentations by each student on a topic of their choice in the area of sleep and mental health. The exact number of lectures will thus depend upon class enrollment in order to allow one hour for each student presentation. Readings will consist of chapters in the Sleep Research Society's Basics of Sleep Guide as well as recent review articles dealing with each lecture topic. Each student presenter will assign the class one original-source report and one comprehensive review on their chosen topic. Student evaluation will be based on weekly open-book study questions, in-class discussions, a brief mid-term quiz, a class presentation and a final paper on the same topic as their presentation.</p>",

Our main goals in this seminar will be: (1) understand Aristotle’s often difficult arguments and how they hang together; (2) see what we can learn about the earlier atomistic theories that Aristotle is rejecting, and the motivations for those earlier theories (Democritus, Leucippus, Plato…); (3) consider how atomists after Aristotle understood and responded to his arguments (Epicurus and his followers). We will also try to understand what is at stake in the debate over atomism — from simple questions like what it is for two things to touch, to larger questions like whether anything ever comes into being or perishes, and, if so, how. Since part of the debate seems to center around different responses to Eleatic arguments concerning the oneness of being and the impossibility of motion (Parmenides, Zeno), we will look at those arguments as well.</p><p>Primary texts will be made available both in Greek and in English translation. Required secondary readings will be in English, together with a few suggested readings in German for those who can read them. The course will assume philosophical competence but no special knowledge of history or languages.</p>",

As an area of public policy it is a response to the perceived deterioration of cities caused by initial poor construction, decay, economic restructuring, regional shifts, suburbanization, and social segregation. Different social groups receive different costs and benefits as a consequence of redevelopment efforts. The objective of this course is to examine the process of urban decline, the kinds of responses that it has evoked, the principal redevelopment actors, the possible range of redevelopment strategies, and the social and spatial impacts of redevelopment efforts.   Topics to be covered include: the history of redevelopment programs; the character of the real estate industry, offices, tourism and entertainment as strategies for central city revival; community-based efforts for neighborhood revitalization; historic preservation and its implications; gentrification; issues of class and race; international comparisons.  <strong>Course requirements</strong>   Class discussion is an essential part of the course. Written assignments will consist of two papers, the first to be based on library research and the second to involve original research.  Assignment 1. A 9-12 page analytic paper presenting both sides of the debate on a controversial topic.  Assignment 2. A field project resulting in a 20-page case study of a development project, a changing neighborhood, or a development actor. If class size permits, the paper will also be presented orally.  <strong>Readings</strong>   The assignments are a mix of xeroxed materials, articles posted on the course web site, and books that you are encouraged to purchase.  </p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>When the \"age of the world picture\" gave way to the \"first machine age,\" architecture went from being a book to being a machine, from representing to doing, from a concern with truth to an emphasis on function. With the dawning of the \"information age\" architecture has again been asked to take account of a shift in paradigms. Many think of the digital as the epochal difference that must be answered, but in fact the digital itself has been enabled - driven - by a more fundamental epistemological and cultural shift: towards a increasingly immersive engagement with an progressively more fluid \"reality,\" where \"doing\" has become play and \"function\" has been supplanted by performance. This time, architecture, like everything else, is a game.  That doesn't make it any easier or less serious, however. This studio will explore the game thesis through the design of a final resting place and display pavilion for the space shuttle Endeavor at the California Science Center at Exposition Park in Los Angeles. The shuttle has been called the \"most complicated machine built in human history.\" The conclusion of the STS (Space Transportation System) program is not only the end of an era of manned space flight, it is also an acknowledgement of the probable limits of mechanical virtuosity - the loss of two out of the original four shuttles revealing the tragic genius of stuff at the tipping point between control and chaos. The design of an \"information age\" exhibition environment devoted to this apotheosis of the waning \"machine age\" (with its implicit curatorial opportunities and critical demands) provides an appropriate arena for gauging the disciplinary effects of the transition from \"doing\" to \"playing.\"  Games are distinguished as much by their rules as by the play those rules enable or circumscribe. In architecture the more important rules are not inherited or legislated, but discovered on the fly, in the feeling of rightness that settles over the project as it is refined during the course of design. A studio focused on game values will therefore not be a technique-driven studio, where \"process\" supplants thinking or stochastic dabbling yields inexplicable results. Instead, the game's natural regard for thinking and cleverness will be operationalized through willful, managed design that explicitly articulates relevant issues regarding the choice of games, their rule sets and criteria for success (and modes of failure), as well as the strategies and tactics of play.  </p>",

Surrounded by seven universities and more than twelve professional schools, Jimbo-cho has provided new, old, and rare books to students, researchers, and the general public. This quarter of small scale wooden structures has survived earthquakes, fires, and bombing making it one of the few remaining districts of the pre-war period. With its small lanes, dense building fabric, and heavy pedestrian use, today it is home to more than 130 book shops, and over 100 small publishing companies. Due to its coveted location at the city center, Jimbo-cho is under considerable development pressure, particularly as the condition of older buildings declines and the publishing industry turns from paper to digital technology. Nonetheless, the urban quality, and intellectual resource represented by the district demand careful consideration of future development strategies.  The purpose of the design studio will be to investigate the district, its history, its physical patterns, and its potential for transformation. After a period of research, site strategies for both growth and preservation will be developed. Within the framework of differing strategies, specific sites will be chosen for architectural development. The goal is to discover more broadly applicable strategies for controlled growth and development in valuable historic districts.

It will be more information than ever produced in the history of recorded civilization. Citizens will be surrounded by a data atmosphere manipulated and spun with mobile devices. The divide between those with and without technological augmentation is in flux. The more important divide for architects is the one of meaningful information in the digital miasma, and the relevance of embedded information within the physical objects of our buildings and cities: we are in real danger of witnessing the loss of the role of design to others. More specialists and experts are now designing - interfaces, tools, devices, vehicles, buildings - than are architects being requested for the same. What was once the province of a total designer from branding to product to production plant is now a reduced package.   But what more can well-crafted buildings - beyond a stately repose of light and mass - hold as information within its collection of elements and occupancy? What can be added to increase its information by several orders of magnitude that still retains meaningful knowledge and experience beyond the digital noise of most internet media?  We will address this challenge with the<i> inversion, </i>a function whereby elements in a closed field becomes transposed by the same procedure to change the contents of that field to another. We will make Architecture Machines again.   The familiar programme of live/work will be reconsidered within a Research and Design environment and will be re-formulated by each part and their relationships - a Domicile/Office/Lab. R&amp;D is the industry's heroic laboratory outside of academic institutions where invention need not immediately answer to market. Research and Development of Architecture Machines is similarly not bound only by programme and form but can be linked with other speculations - garments, robotics, material, interaction, reconfiguration. The new programmatic conditions will interrupt established patterns of usage, or rhythms of civic life; patterns that may become transformed with an anomaly not easily discarded due to its intrinsic links within the design discipline. Connecting known architectural types and devices for the unknown or the recently-lost through inversion will create a methodology to engage a synthetic world of nature and machine and architecture, where the machine is not reduced to a technological filter or interface. The inversion of nature and the uncanny agent-to-agent relationship is then highly compelling as Machine will come to mean an autonomous agent, a player or author - as the architect is also a player or author - engaged in conversation.   Our siting of the Research and Development Domicile/Office/Lab is in the old industrial ports of Montreal, with its layering and its past promises of future life (Expo 67 and the 76 Olympics). Bounded by the Vieux Port, its adjacent Quais and the Cit<i>é</i>-du-Havre, the project recognizes its industrial past and the harbingers from the Expo.</p>",

Integrating strange subcultures, classical temples, natural ecologies, rituals, parties and contemporary culture into architectural proposals, the studio will redefine the notion of publicness offering a countermodel to the ever-present spaces of spectacle and consumption, being creative and at the same time critical of, while exploring alternative forms of being together.</p> <p>Conceived as distinct enclaves within the city dedicated to pleasure along the banks of the Thames, Pleasure Gardens were inwalled worlds of small wonders where social classes and hierarchies were put under discussion and flattened. Shifting programs and types from the private realm to the public, they became fertile grounds for extravagance, alternative activities and social constructs. During their two hundred year existence beginning in the 17th century, they redefined leisure and pleasure publicly by putting together and reinventing menageries, rotundas, music halls, supper-boxes, kitchen gardens, pavilions, lighting and fireworks, public houses, lay temples, fountains, panoramas, immersive world maps and conservatories to recreate a series of alternative counter-microcosms opposed to the daily routines and miseries of the big city.</p> <p>By revisiting the notion of Pleasure Gardens, the studio (named The Consortium of Fantastic Ideas) will develop a set of medium-scale interiorized public buildings.

To be located in London, it will subvert the idea of the spectacular banal that has dominated most of the recent examples of public space by understanding and exploring the cultural and political nature of public space and studying relevant public interiors along history.

This disk is constantly heaving and falling, at regular intervals; the margin is especially active, so much so, that, at times, it is stretched on a level with the whole surface of the disk, which, in such a condition, is almost flat, while, at other times, it is so fully arched that it assumes the appearance of a hemisphere...’</i>  --Louis Agassiz, Contributions to the Natural History of the United States (1862)</p> <p>  In recent studios we explored various aspects of the visual representation of the American Landscape. This year’s studio will extend our research into the expanding knowledge and emerging theories derived by both naturalists and fine artists discovering the New World of Americas. We will explore - from the macro to the micro, from the comprehensive to the incisive - notions of how to collect, map, dissect, examine, describe, classify and display. As Coleridge observed: all men are born Aristotelians or Platonists. The Platonist feel that classes, orders, and genres are realities; the Aristotelians, that they are generalizations. For the latter, language is nothing but an approximate set of symbols; for the former, it is the map of the universe. The Platonist knows that the universe is somehow a cosmos, an order; that order, for the Aristotelian, can be an error or a fiction of our partial knowledge.(1)</p> <p>During this year studio we will explore the rare archives, hidden collections and lost treasures at Harvard University in search for inspiration to create a new ‘Museum of Curiosity’, which displays and debates the promiscuous discourse between the dialectic worlds of fine arts and the natural sciences.

The modernist poet Erza Pound was greatly impressed by Agassiz methodical and thorough prose descriptions and the fact that Louis Agassiz had a reputation for locking up students in an isolated room for weeks in row with the simple task to meticulous describe a slowly disintegrating sunfish. (Obvious Agassiz was not a Platonist. Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced, reducing the specimen to its constituent parts.

These spaces were created through the agency of New York City's incentive zoning program beginning in 1961. Often referred to as 'bonus plazas' the legal and design history of this type of open space in New York City is detailed in Jerold Kayden's book \"Privately Owned Public Spaces, the New York City Experience. Over 503 of these spaces exist in New York City predominately in Manhattan, with approximately 75 concentrated in the central mid-town area.  This studio will address the issue of this type of open space as part of a larger inquiry of the potential of interstitial spaces. Interstitial spaces are difficult design problems and particularly challenging in densely built urban areas. The studio will look at spaces that are normally overlooked, poorly designed or underutilized. The focus will be on intervening spaces; the relatively small and narrow areas that occur between other things.   Interstitial spaces occur in diverse situations and contexts. Some respond to unusual or particular program conditions, many are linear and involve connections and linkages, while others are left over bits and pieces. Often these spaces occupy the margins of infrastructure or are part of building structures. Interstitial spaces may be vertical as well as horizontal, autonomous as well as highly integrated. We will address social factors and environmental conditions as well as design concerns. A preoccupation of the studio will be with the medium of urban landscape and particularly issues of concept, materiality and fabrication.  Studio methodology will be organized around three exercises: \"Prototype\" conceptualizing new open space systems and furnishings; \"Provisional Space\" addressing temporary interventions, and \"Design Proposition\", focusing on developed design of specific open spaces.   The studio will be structured as a set of related design exercises, readings, and parallel investigations to further an understanding of issues of content, representation, context, and scale. This studio will be conducted in parallel with design studios addressing the problem of privately owned public spaces at six other northeast region universities.   Students from all GSD programs are welcome. There will be one unfunded field trip to New York City.    </p>",

The governments of Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City partnered with the Rouse Company to transform “derelict” waterfront sites to popular shopping destinations using historic and postmodern architecture. In 1981, the cover of TIME declared the Festival Marketplace the victor over the urban crisis: “CITIES ARE FUN” emblazoned over Rouse’s pale grandfatherly face. All the while, Newark, New Jersey, long used and abused by mainstream discourse as an icon of deterioration, drawn by the vision of reinvigorated metropolitan freedom and pleasure, waited for its Festival Marketplace. As urban and architectural thinkers began publishing books like Variations on a Theme Park using the Festival Marketplace itself as an icon for neoliberal spatial injustice, the replacing of real cities by inauthentic corporate ones, Newark, fighting for its place in the urban renaissance pantheon, waited. Today, while traditional Festival Marketplaces like New York’s South Street Seaport and St. Louis’s Union Station are declared unmarketable and in need of redevelopment by their owners, Newark still waits. This studio will take up the liberatory kernel of the Festival Marketplace to imagine what Newark has been waiting for. </p> <p>Drawing on Newark’s rich post-Great Migration culture and politics, this interdisciplinary studio challenges students of architecture, planning, and urban design to use their whimsy and the tools of their disciplines towards designing inclusive cities in an age of increasing inequality.

Then, thinking through community organizing, popular education, and anti-racist training, we will propose and test design and planning decisions for Newark’s riverfront at the intersection between tactical urbanism and advocacy planning, working at diverse temporal and spatial scales. Design strategies will include architecture as signs and systems, radical post-modernism, environmental justice education, urban pedagogy, cultural programs, and Plan-Build prototypes.  </p>",

In cities torn by sectarian strife, political division and economic balkanization, urbanism's capacity to change perceptions and forge new understandings is put to the test. In these places, urbanism sets the agenda for an architecture of engagement. </p><p> Belfast, Northern Ireland is perhaps the prime existing example of a divided city in the western hemisphere. Despite its recent peace accords, Belfast is still seen and occupied in a highly coded way that resists the improvements brought by typical genres of 'restorative' urbanism and 'signature' architecture. </p><p> To recast Belfast, the studio will bring experimental techniques of representation and design to bear on a two-fold process. We will first make a series of readings - eco-topographic, morphological, economic and cultural - of existing relationships between the city and its port, and subsequently stage a series of distinct architectural and landscape projects within this new delineation of the city. </p><p> The studio is being sponsored by The Belfast Harbour Commissioners and Titanic Quarter Limited, with the active support and participation of the Belfast City Council. Funding will allow the studio to travel to Ireland and publish a book based on its findings. There is also extensive documentation, including three-dimensional data and research on Belfast and Ireland that will be made available to the studio.</p><p>  <b>BELFAST <i>beyond</i> 'THE TROUBLES'</b> After years of strife and paramilitary violence between Nationalist, Catholic interests who fought to end British rule over the Ulster region, and Unionist, Protestant interests who fought to maintain allegiance to the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland's population is finding a way to peacefully coexist. Over the past decade, Ireland as a whole has seen a resurgence of its fortunes and its place in the global economy, becoming a key site of cultural, economic and even design innovation on the European continent. The resurgence of Dublin has been well chronicled, but the role of Belfast, as the capital of the North, is just now emerging. A new enthusiasm for the city's future is now palpable. Members of the younger generations, new immigrants and long term residents eager to leave behind ''The Troubles'' are all seeking another Belfast. </p><p> Many plans and projects are under way. Urbanistically though, the city is still held captive by its two intertwined histories of industrial development and sectarian strife. The years of violence and British attempts to quell discord through stealth modes of urban planning have had their effect. Yet, Belfast's physical character was already forged before the partitioning of Northern Ireland in 1921, when the city emerged as a key site of British Industrial production in the late nineteenth century. Where architecture and urban design are concerned, the physical consequences of Belfast's rise and precipitous fall as a modern, industrial port city have never been fully reconciled with the spatial implications of the political and socioeconomic division between its Protestant and Catholic communities. Much of Belfast, outside the city's immediate center, which was cordoned off during 'the troubles', is still claimed by one community or another. </p><p> Until now, no one has resided in the vast areas built to accommodate Belfast's port and industries.

Hand-in- hand with the more practical ambition of the option studios, it is intended to help us devise formal prototypes for architectural consumption while broadening our understanding of the rigours of abstraction and formal analysis.  With equal emphasis on theoretical reading, graphic analysis and diagramming, elementary mathematics, numerically controlled fabrication techniques, and theoretical writing, the seminar will circle, in increasingly tight loops, the surface as object of knowledge.  Semi-monthly hands-on workshops on modulation and fabrication will supplement the cycle of theoretical readings and discussions, leading to the conception, analysis, calculation, drawing, and making of an intricate superficial structure.  This year the seminar will incorporate a directed reading sequence of seven classic texts. There will be one assigned group reading per session, followed by a short student presentation and a group precept on the text. The broad focus of the discussion will not discriminate among issues of technique, formal analysis, art criticism, art history/theory -or even the study of language itself.   <b>Reading List (Required)</b> Roland Barthes Cy Twombly: <i>Works on Paper</i> in The Responsibility of Forms, pp.157-176, University of California Press Berkeley, 1991 Rosalind Krauss <i>Grids</i> in The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths, The MIT Press, Boston 1986.

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>Introduction to Graphic Design is an intensive twelve week course that formats lectures and studio classes to engage students in the  practical applications of graphic design. The format allows students to respond to lectures and course material as it is presented with  studio projects. The course addresses the issues of overall visual literacy and the ever changing role of the architect and planner. In  addition to the traditional elements of graphic design - typography, image use, color and production - reading, research, and critique  create a discourse on the effects of graphic design and a consideration of its meaning in a cultural context. History lectures and readings expose students to some of the overlaps, influences, and patterns in modern and contemporary design, while technical lectures explain basic production and printing procedures. Lectures include presentations of examples of magazine, catalogue, book, portfolio design, packaging, websites, and film and television titles.  Practical demonstrations show similar working methods to architecture, showing the consideration and presentation of ideas, the process of sketches, mock ups, revisions, materials, details, finish, manufacture, and production. The development and design of a research essay demonstrates the importance of integration of content and design. This final assignment concentrates student's efforts on the ability to edit and the importance of the assembly and the consideration of the presentation of projects.  Pedagogic Objective: To explore the culture and potential of graphic design, and to evaluate the ideas behind and created and engaged by it.  Time Commitment: Three hours of studio/lecture per week.  Basis of Final Grade: Quality of ideas and their execution and an evaluation of dedication of the student. Grades are based on two projects, a book report, and final essay document.</p>",
