397937	The Forms of Water: Aquatic Landscapes in South America	Spring	2014	Design Theory	Architecture	DES	Urban Planning and Design	Seminar	200140	"<p>South America can be analyzed as an aquatic territory: the three major river basins (Orinoco	 Amazonas and the Plata)	 ground waters as the Guaraní aquifer	 or the immense southern iced fields	 claim the attention of global environmental policies	 which are today focused on water. However	 the economic and social advantages offered by plans of development	 largely based on these resources	 seem to be in conflict with ecological and cultural issues	 in a subcontinent with isolated communities and territories practically “untouched” by western civilization. These unsolved oppositions force us to reconsider the usual ways in which we understand and transform the world. In this perspective	 South America can be considered as a test case. </p> <p>Throughout this seminar	 we will link the theoretical questions that water poses with concrete cases. We will deal first with the big dimension of fluvial infrastructure	 considering debates	 projects and executions through the last two centuries. This part of the seminar is linked with the transcontinental research network South American Project / GSD.</p> <p>From this broad picture we will move to what was once known as the “Jesuit Republic”	 the most renowned example of heterotopia followed between the XVII and XVIII C. The fluvial region	 under the hegemony of the guaraní people when the Conquest began	 was deeply transformed by the Jesuits. The area can also be considered in terms of its energetic potential and its natural “monuments” (Iguazú Falls). Prof. Silvetti’s concurrent Option Studio will deal with an intervention in this same region.</p> <p>We will consider next the cities and ports	 which commanded from the first centuries after the Conquest the whole process of territorial control. Today	 around 80% of the population of South America is urban: the contrast between its “virgin” hearth and metropolis like Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires is a key element in our discussion. </p> <p>The last case concerns the iced Patagonia and Antarctica. Through the “frozen continent” we fully enter the global world. Patagonia has been inhabited since 15000 years ago	 but Antarctica can be considered the last no-man’s land	 “without” human history	 the Paradise of Science. </p> <p>The seminar will consist in lectures and discussions. As the semester goes on	 the students are invited to present their own cases of interest in the South American region	 selected among those which were considered	 or proposing new ones. The oral presentations will be the basis of the papers that students will submit at the end of the course.</p>"	2014
339071	Global Oral Health: Interdisciplinary Approaches	Spring	2019	Dental Health	Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology	DH	Harvard School of Dental Medicine	Lecture	210959	"This is a discussion-based critical thinking course that examines the extensive relationship between oral health and global health	 and concept development is heavily determined by class participation.  By incorporating the global burden of oral diseases into discussions of readings by Amartya Sen	 Jeffrey Sacks	 Paul Collier	 and others	 students will begin to define the principles of global oral health.  These include the ways in which globalization affects oral health	 and how oral diseases are associated with poverty	 HIV/AIDS	 diabetes	 maternal and child health	 poor mental health	 cardiovascular disease	 poor nutrition	 tobacco	 and alcohol.  Complete health and an end to global poverty are not possible without including oral health in global policies and practices	 and this course demonstrates how interdisciplinary approaches can be incorporated into policy and practice through the example of oral health.  By the end of this course	 the student will be able to demonstrate an understanding of: the global burden of oral diseases/conditions: prevalence	 distribution	 associated risk factors	 and the relationship between oral disease	 population trends	 and global disease patterns; the range of global oral health research questions and issues of research conduct and resulting health policies	 including ethical concerns and human rights; the concepts of interdisciplinary collaboration regarding global health policy and practice;  how global oral health systems impact their respective populations	 including the components of those systems such as workforce	 financing mechanisms	 and service delivery;  how oral health may be integrated into primary care; Understanding roles and functions of global and domestic oral health and related agencies and organizations and an understanding of cultural competence regarding oral health services and interactions with global health systems."	2019

Dylan has been at the center of popular culture ever since he arrived in New York City on 24 January 1961	 from Hibbing MN	 by way of Minneapolis	 Madison and Chicago. The seminar will trace the evolution of his songs and lyrics from its early folk	 even earlier rock and roll	 gospel	 and protest roots	 through the transition from acoustic to electric	 also through the many evolutions	 reinventions	 and innovations that followed—and that continue to emerge. We will also focus on Dylan’s frustrations of audience expectation	 from the anger evoked by his apparent abandonment of the serious protest and static urban folk traditions	 to his apparent embracing of Christianity	 to attacks focused on Dylan’s “plagiarism” which show a lack of understanding of the vital and original literary process that expects the reader/listener to notice the thefts and reworkings. The seminar will also explore the multiple versions of many of Dylan’s songs that show him to be not unlike an oral poet in his ability to re-perform and recreate through performance	 in the process often transforming utterly the original lyrics and meanings of his own songs. Attention will be given to the ways in which Dylan’s career builds up through periods of evolution and experimentation to productions that can only be called “classics” from a diachronic perspective	 among others Highway 61 Revisited (1965)	 Blonde on Blonde (1966)	 Blood on the Tracks (1975)	 “Love and Theft” (2001)	 Modern Times (2006)	 Tempest (2012)	 and the bootleg and outtakes from the 1990s to the astonishing Telltale Signs (2008)and the highly revealing The Cutting Edge (2015). The seminar will also consider Dylan’s role in film	 particularly the brilliant commercial failure	 Masked and Anonymous	 from 2003	 a work of high allegorical import. We will also look at Todd Haynes’ insightful 2007 movie I’m Not There	 which captures the essence of some of Dylan’s persona creation	 even though it initially met with bafflement from many critics. We will also read Dylan’s Chronicles vol. 1	 itself a work of genius	 a sprawling Dylan prose song posing as an autobiography.</p>"	2016.5
34076	The Moral Compass	Fall	2016	Freshman Seminar	Freshman Seminars	FRSEMR	Freshman Seminars	Freshman Seminar	203401	"<p>What determines the moral values and principles that orient and guide the lives of individuals and societies—the “moral compass” we use to navigate through the thickets of decision and indecision? What is this compass	 and where does it come from? Is it God-given? Or	 rather	 is it the product of culture and society? Or is it perhaps a matter of our genes	 an evolutionarily-determined instinct? Or	 instead	 is it the province of Reason	 discoverable through the rational intellect (possibly by analogy to logic or mathematics)? Further	 we might ask	 is there just one compass	 or maybe several legitimate ones	 which can sometimes point in different and even incompatible directions? This course will explore a range of candidates for the moral compass or compasses. The aim is to better understand these candidates	 by reflecting on a number of attempts to develop and defend—or	 in some cases	 criticize and reject—a particular moral compass. We will read and discuss authors ranging from antiquity to the present day	 including Aristotle	 David Hume	 Immanuel Kant	 Friedrich Nietzsche	 and Hannah Arendt	 and examine how their ideas are reflected in works of art and reportage. A primary aim of the class will be to learn how to analyze	 evaluate	 and construct a philosophical argument	 both in writing and in oral conversation. Another aim is to gain acquaintance with key figures and texts in the history of Western philosophy. A third aim is to practice adopting a reflective stance towards one’s own moral compass and its philosophical underpinnings.</p>"	2016.5
33650	"Afro-Cuba: History	 Culture and Conflict"	Fall	2016	Freshman Seminar	Freshman Seminars	FRSEMR	Freshman Seminars	Freshman Seminar	203006	"<p>Ninety-five percent of the Africans transported to the Americas from the 16th century to the 19th century did not come to the United States	 but went instead to Latin America and the Caribbean. African-based cultural forms are clearly visible in the religious	 musical	 dance	 oral	 and community practices of numerous countries in Latin America. Through complex processes of creolization	 filtering	 and incorporation	 those cultural expressions have become icons of “national” cultures. From tango in Argentina to rumba in Cuba	 from Brazilian Candomblé to Haitian Vodou	 the Africans and their descendants have left indelible marks in the cultures of the region. How did this happen? How did the cultures of the enslaved Africans become national cultural symbols in Latin America? We explore these questions using the example of Cuba	 which was	 not counting Brazil	 the last country to abolish slavery in the Americas (1886). The Afro-Cubans’ struggles for recognition and equality are inseparable from the conflicts surrounding the creation of Cuba as an independent nation	 from United States efforts to control the island for most of the 20th century	 and from the Cuban revolution of 1959. This seminar explores how Africans and their descendants have shaped the formation of a national culture in Cuba and how their contributions have frequently met with resistance and opposition. The seminar covers from colonial times to the present	 but emphasis is placed on the cultural production of postrevolutionary and contemporary Cuba	 including recent developments in the visual arts	 music (especially Hiphop)	 and cinema.</p>"	2016.5

106807	Architecture in Early Modern England: Themes and Methods	Fall	2018	History and Theory	Architecture	HIS	Architecture	Seminar	207969	"<p>This seminar takes a selective approach to architectural culture in 16th- and 17th-century England (that is	 roughly speaking	 from the Tudor period to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London in 1666). The seminar is divided into rubrics or themes chosen to highlight questions of patronage and class	 the spatial implications of pageantry	 material culture and display	 architecture and literature	 the ideology of kingship and the rewriting of the past	 the transformation of urban environments	 and the role of science and technology.  We will begin with the phenomenon of prodigy houses	 so-called by the British architectural historian John Summerson to characterize the large-scale “proud	 ambitious heaps” finding their apogee during the reign of Elizabeth I. We will then	 under the aegis of the rhetoric of architecture	 explore the legibility and poetics of architecture (from the country house poem as genre to Inigo Jones’s masques and	 later	 John Vanbrugh’s Restoration comedies). Urban design will be treated in a variety of contexts so as to explore early modern notions of public space (examples might range from the market square and the city gate to the rebuilding of London’s churches after the Great Fire). This will be followed by a consideration of some of the exchanges between architecture and science (Robert Hooke’s anatomy theatre or Christopher Wren’s interest in astronomy) as well as the culture of scientific tools. The seminar concludes with antiquarianism and the rewriting of the past from Stonehenge to the Temple of Solomon. Seminar participants will be encouraged to explore the projects and works of architects such as (but not limited to): John Shute	 Robert Smythson	 Inigo Jones	 John Webb	 Roger Pratt	 John Evelyn	 Christopher Wren	 Elizabeth Wilbraham	 Robert Hooke	 Nicholas Hawksmoor	 John Vanbrugh. Requirements include: weekly responses to readings	 discussion participation	 oral presentation	 and final paper (15-20pp).  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This advanced history elective is designed for students in the postprofessional (MDES) and doctoral programs (PHD/DDES) as well as students in the professional programs who have completed core and	 preferably	 are embarking on thesis. Some knowledge of the early modern history and theory of architecture is required.</p>"	2018.5

Combining micro- and macro-perspectives	 it approaches design history from a broad aesthetic	 historical	 and anthropological standpoint. The seminar combines readings from Ponge	 contemporary Thing Theory	 and design history	 with materials from literature	 popular culture	 and media. Case studies will include: the Bialetti Moka Express	 the Vespa scooter	 Mario Bellini's Olivetti Logos calculators from the late 1970s	 and Bruno Munari's 'Chair for Brief Visits.' Its aim is to prompt students to reflect upon the complexity of design thinking	 and of the ways in which objects shape and are shaped by everyday life	 with particular attention to the contemporary consequences of the object lessons around which the seminar will hinge. Each session will be devoted to the thick description	 analysis	 and study of a single case history. In addition to a short oral presentation	 students in Fifteen Things will be asked to develop semester-long projects that either assume the form of a research paper or a design project.</p>"	2009.5
