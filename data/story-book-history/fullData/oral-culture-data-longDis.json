Building on the strength of two years of work in the Library Test Kitchen, this studio will research and produce an experimental documentary exploring library hybrids, with special focus on the Harvard Depository, where nine million of the documents that make up the university’s collections are stored. Students will explore the cultural and technical dimensions of libraries, depositories, and storage facilities; produce ethnography, oral history, and other writing; practice video production and editing; and engage in website design and development. Students with interest in the history of libraries or with media production or technical skills are particularly welcome.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>South America can be analyzed as an aquatic territory: the three major river basins (Orinoco, Amazonas and the Plata), ground waters as the Guaraní aquifer, or the immense southern iced fields, claim the attention of global environmental policies, which are today focused on water. However, the economic and social advantages offered by plans of development, largely based on these resources, seem to be in conflict with ecological and cultural issues, in a subcontinent with isolated communities and territories practically “untouched” by western civilization. These unsolved oppositions force us to reconsider the usual ways in which we understand and transform the world. In this perspective, South America can be considered as a test case. </p> <p>Throughout this seminar, we will link the theoretical questions that water poses with concrete cases. We will deal first with the big dimension of fluvial infrastructure, considering debates, projects and executions through the last two centuries. This part of the seminar is linked with the transcontinental research network South American Project / GSD.</p> <p>From this broad picture we will move to what was once known as the “Jesuit Republic”, the most renowned example of heterotopia followed between the XVII and XVIII C. The fluvial region, under the hegemony of the guaraní people when the Conquest began, was deeply transformed by the Jesuits. The area can also be considered in terms of its energetic potential and its natural “monuments” (Iguazú Falls). Prof. Silvetti’s concurrent Option Studio will deal with an intervention in this same region.</p> <p>We will consider next the cities and ports, which commanded from the first centuries after the Conquest the whole process of territorial control. Today, around 80% of the population of South America is urban: the contrast between its “virgin” hearth and metropolis like Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires is a key element in our discussion. </p> <p>The last case concerns the iced Patagonia and Antarctica. Through the “frozen continent” we fully enter the global world. Patagonia has been inhabited since 15000 years ago, but Antarctica can be considered the last no-man’s land, “without” human history, the Paradise of Science. </p> <p>The seminar will consist in lectures and discussions. As the semester goes on, the students are invited to present their own cases of interest in the South American region, selected among those which were considered, or proposing new ones. The oral presentations will be the basis of the papers that students will submit at the end of the course.</p>",

By incorporating the global burden of oral diseases into discussions of readings by Amartya Sen, Jeffrey Sacks, Paul Collier, and others, students will begin to define the principles of global oral health.  These include the ways in which globalization affects oral health, and how oral diseases are associated with poverty, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, maternal and child health, poor mental health, cardiovascular disease, poor nutrition, tobacco, and alcohol.  Complete health and an end to global poverty are not possible without including oral health in global policies and practices, and this course demonstrates how interdisciplinary approaches can be incorporated into policy and practice through the example of oral health.  By the end of this course, the student will be able to demonstrate an understanding of: the global burden of oral diseases/conditions: prevalence, distribution, associated risk factors, and the relationship between oral disease, population trends, and global disease patterns; the range of global oral health research questions and issues of research conduct and resulting health policies, including ethical concerns and human rights; the concepts of interdisciplinary collaboration regarding global health policy and practice;  how global oral health systems impact their respective populations, including the components of those systems such as workforce, financing mechanisms, and service delivery;  how oral health may be integrated into primary care; Understanding roles and functions of global and domestic oral health and related agencies and organizations and an understanding of cultural competence regarding oral health services and interactions with global health systems.",

Set in rural southern Costa Rica, this unique 1-week extension program will be embedded in some of the pressing grand challenges in the field of global health: achieving universal health care, environmental degradation, migrations and the demographic, nutritional, and epidemiological transition. The program provides students with a broad understanding of health and the social, political, cultural, behavioral and economic forces that influence health access, health outcomes, and health systems.  This program represents an opportunity in which the interaction between the theoretical content and the identification of common factors of health inequities is realized through an immersive experience. Participants will be able to experience the multiple components that determine health, expanding their competencies within an ethically responsible and participatory approach.</p>",

While asking whether these fictions constitute a distinct genre, ``the Native American novel,'' we will consider how the writers' projects challenge the assumptions of post-modern literature, raise issues central to post-colonial theory, and exploit the polyvocality of novelistic form.

Dylan has been at the center of popular culture ever since he arrived in New York City on 24 January 1961, from Hibbing MN, by way of Minneapolis, Madison and Chicago. The seminar will trace the evolution of his songs and lyrics from its early folk, even earlier rock and roll, gospel, and protest roots, through the transition from acoustic to electric, also through the many evolutions, reinventions, and innovations that followed—and that continue to emerge. We will also focus on Dylan’s frustrations of audience expectation, from the anger evoked by his apparent abandonment of the serious protest and static urban folk traditions, to his apparent embracing of Christianity, to attacks focused on Dylan’s “plagiarism” which show a lack of understanding of the vital and original literary process that expects the reader/listener to notice the thefts and reworkings. The seminar will also explore the multiple versions of many of Dylan’s songs that show him to be not unlike an oral poet in his ability to re-perform and recreate through performance, in the process often transforming utterly the original lyrics and meanings of his own songs. Attention will be given to the ways in which Dylan’s career builds up through periods of evolution and experimentation to productions that can only be called “classics” from a diachronic perspective, among others Highway 61 Revisited (1965), Blonde on Blonde (1966), Blood on the Tracks (1975), “Love and Theft” (2001), Modern Times (2006), Tempest (2012), and the bootleg and outtakes from the 1990s to the astonishing Telltale Signs (2008)and the highly revealing The Cutting Edge (2015). The seminar will also consider Dylan’s role in film, particularly the brilliant commercial failure, Masked and Anonymous, from 2003, a work of high allegorical import. We will also look at Todd Haynes’ insightful 2007 movie I’m Not There, which captures the essence of some of Dylan’s persona creation, even though it initially met with bafflement from many critics. We will also read Dylan’s Chronicles vol. 1, itself a work of genius, a sprawling Dylan prose song posing as an autobiography.</p>",

What is this compass, and where does it come from? Is it God-given? Or, rather, is it the product of culture and society? Or is it perhaps a matter of our genes, an evolutionarily-determined instinct? Or, instead, is it the province of Reason, discoverable through the rational intellect (possibly by analogy to logic or mathematics)? Further, we might ask, is there just one compass, or maybe several legitimate ones, which can sometimes point in different and even incompatible directions? This course will explore a range of candidates for the moral compass or compasses. The aim is to better understand these candidates, by reflecting on a number of attempts to develop and defend—or, in some cases, criticize and reject—a particular moral compass. We will read and discuss authors ranging from antiquity to the present day, including Aristotle, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Hannah Arendt, and examine how their ideas are reflected in works of art and reportage. A primary aim of the class will be to learn how to analyze, evaluate, and construct a philosophical argument, both in writing and in oral conversation. Another aim is to gain acquaintance with key figures and texts in the history of Western philosophy. A third aim is to practice adopting a reflective stance towards one’s own moral compass and its philosophical underpinnings.</p>",

African-based cultural forms are clearly visible in the religious, musical, dance, oral, and community practices of numerous countries in Latin America. Through complex processes of creolization, filtering, and incorporation, those cultural expressions have become icons of “national” cultures. From tango in Argentina to rumba in Cuba, from Brazilian Candomblé to Haitian Vodou, the Africans and their descendants have left indelible marks in the cultures of the region. How did this happen? How did the cultures of the enslaved Africans become national cultural symbols in Latin America? We explore these questions using the example of Cuba, which was, not counting Brazil, the last country to abolish slavery in the Americas (1886). The Afro-Cubans’ struggles for recognition and equality are inseparable from the conflicts surrounding the creation of Cuba as an independent nation, from United States efforts to control the island for most of the 20th century, and from the Cuban revolution of 1959. This seminar explores how Africans and their descendants have shaped the formation of a national culture in Cuba and how their contributions have frequently met with resistance and opposition. The seminar covers from colonial times to the present, but emphasis is placed on the cultural production of postrevolutionary and contemporary Cuba, including recent developments in the visual arts, music (especially Hiphop), and cinema.</p>",

The seminar is divided into rubrics or themes chosen to highlight questions of patronage and class, the spatial implications of pageantry, material culture and display, architecture and literature, the ideology of kingship and the rewriting of the past, the transformation of urban environments, and the role of science and technology.  We will begin with the phenomenon of prodigy houses, so-called by the British architectural historian John Summerson to characterize the large-scale “proud, ambitious heaps” finding their apogee during the reign of Elizabeth I. We will then, under the aegis of the rhetoric of architecture, explore the legibility and poetics of architecture (from the country house poem as genre to Inigo Jones’s masques and, later, John Vanbrugh’s Restoration comedies). Urban design will be treated in a variety of contexts so as to explore early modern notions of public space (examples might range from the market square and the city gate to the rebuilding of London’s churches after the Great Fire). This will be followed by a consideration of some of the exchanges between architecture and science (Robert Hooke’s anatomy theatre or Christopher Wren’s interest in astronomy) as well as the culture of scientific tools. The seminar concludes with antiquarianism and the rewriting of the past from Stonehenge to the Temple of Solomon. Seminar participants will be encouraged to explore the projects and works of architects such as (but not limited to): John Shute, Robert Smythson, Inigo Jones, John Webb, Roger Pratt, John Evelyn, Christopher Wren, Elizabeth Wilbraham, Robert Hooke, Nicholas Hawksmoor, John Vanbrugh. Requirements include: weekly responses to readings, discussion participation, oral presentation, and final paper (15-20pp).  <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> This advanced history elective is designed for students in the postprofessional (MDES) and doctoral programs (PHD/DDES) as well as students in the professional programs who have completed core and, preferably, are embarking on thesis. Some knowledge of the early modern history and theory of architecture is required.</p>",

Combining micro- and macro-perspectives, it approaches design history from a broad aesthetic, historical, and anthropological standpoint. The seminar combines readings from Ponge, contemporary Thing Theory, and design history, with materials from literature, popular culture, and media. Case studies will include: the Bialetti Moka Express, the Vespa scooter, Mario Bellini's Olivetti Logos calculators from the late 1970s, and Bruno Munari's 'Chair for Brief Visits.' Its aim is to prompt students to reflect upon the complexity of design thinking, and of the ways in which objects shape and are shaped by everyday life, with particular attention to the contemporary consequences of the object lessons around which the seminar will hinge. Each session will be devoted to the thick description, analysis, and study of a single case history. In addition to a short oral presentation, students in Fifteen Things will be asked to develop semester-long projects that either assume the form of a research paper or a design project.</p>",

With its unique combination of mythical, heroic and historical components, the Persian Book of Kings is also one of the most widely illustrated narratives in the Islamicate arts of the book. Alongside the reading of the Shahname in Dick Davis’ authoritative English translation, students will become acquainted with the great Persian epic as a living tradition of telling and retelling in written, visual and oral form. Topics include the elements of marvel, romance and ethics characteristic of the epic genre, and the relationship between the text of the poem and its manuscript illustrations.</p>",
