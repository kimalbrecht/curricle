    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>The Library, up there with the US Postal Service, represents one of the most exciting institutional design opportunities out there. Library Test Kitchen is a semester long immersion in this storied institution. New directions ahead will be explored through class discussion, exposure to the larger library landscape, and rapid prototyping. Students with relevant thesis topics or outside interests are encouraged to use the seminar as a workshop to further develop and iterate on their current thinking. Our goal is to show the library world— not tell it— new futures with the projects we build.   Library Test Kitchen (LTK) is about making real things the world sees. In the Fall of 2012, LTK created LABRARY, a Pop-Up Library in the center of Harvard Square. It was an exciting public project, a truly collaborative endeavor which earned our seminar the ear and curious eye of the national library community. (For more past projects and press see www.librarytestkitchen.org.)  Library Test Kitchen III will refocus our attention on developing individual projects that we’ll call Library Machines.  “Library Machine - a mechanically or electronically operated device for performing library functions.”   Library Machines exist between industrial design and architecture. They may be built, coded, sewn, etc. They may be experiences, instruments, applications or efficiencies. They may be found in reading rooms, on the reference desk, deep in the stacks or outside the library altogether.   Each Library Machine will be designed for, and installed in, one of two sites: the Loeb Library at the Graduate School of Design or a new Pop-Up LABRARY truck that will be parked in one of Harvard’s common spaces.   By the end of the semester, Library Machines will be operational prototypes the public will experience. They’ll also be packaged — polished, named and documented with print-ready copy and photography — readily pitch-able to the media outlets who like us.  Coursework will be informed by seminar discussions touching on, among other topics: the history of US libraries; library architecture; contemporary case studies; forces of change; the evolution of library technologies; tools and assistive technologies; and the qualities and cultures of successful learning labs, makerspaces and other creative environments. Discussions will be supplemented by guest speakers and field trips (Harvard Depository, Museum of Science).  This seminar is open to graduate and undergraduate students from across Harvard and MIT. The course is taught by Ann Whiteside and Jeff Goldston, with Jeffrey Schnapp, and assisted by Jessica Yurkofsky.  www.librarytestkitchen.org</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>The Workshop explores fabrication and material potential of weaving methods to consider possibilities for habitation structures. Weaving exists in every culture. It is one of the most ancient and primitive techniques. At the same time, because of its binary nature, it is conducive to be directly converted to digital fabrication method. In between there are degrees of technical sophistication in manufacturing, which one can study to reflect on the relationship between industrialization and civilization. This is a fabrication method where low tech and high tech can co exist as well as ancient and contemporary aesthetic. According to the performance requirements, such as insulation, waterproofing, ventilation and structural strength, a weave can be densified, layered, or combined.  The first part of the semester will focus on theoretical, historical and technical research combined with hand made prototype creation. In addition material research addresses to explore different material for the use, such as natural fiber from renewable resource such as grass, banana leaf or from completely artificial source. The economic and political implication of use of specific material will be discussed for its renewable, recyclable properties or potential for appropriation of materials previously not considered for this method. In mid April, we will be joined by a textile engineer artist, Dai Fujiwara who has invented circular digital weaving method for Issey Miyake's APOC clothing. It is a single form manufacturing where weaving command is prescribed digitally to produce all the specifications in one form. Instead of sewing or tailoring, cutting allows the form to emerge in this production. We will have a workshop with him to explore specific fabrication method, concept and relationship between weaving and digital media.   </p>",

This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Core area requirement for Literature and Arts B.</p>",

The capacity of architecture to respond to complex negotiations and to adapt to particular milieus has received greater attention. In short, architecture in Europe has become more reponsive and, in some respects, finer. Using concrete examples, the course addresses the nature of architectural experience vis a vis abstractions such as concepts, theories, types and principles.  The course consists of three bi-weekly sessions, each being dedicated to one of three themes: difference, experience and sensibility. In each session, a first lecture will examine in detail a major building of the recent past. A second lecture will present a historical case study in which an extreme approach to the theme was adopted, and which will put the building studied on the previous day in a wider perspective. Each lecture will be followed by a discussion and, schedule permitting, tutorials leading to the submission of an essay.

The neoavantgarde attempted to engage a context that seemed to refuse architecture's former cultural vocation, if not architecture itself. The course will see that struggle as the precondition for current architectural practice.

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>Digital design remains one of the few areas within the discipline of architecture that remains relatively under theorized. This situation is in part the result of the novelty of the area, in that digital design is still a relatively new field that has yet to develop its own theoretical framework, but it is also in part the result of the still existent skepticism towards computation, a skepticism surprisingly common among architectural theorists. For many, it would seem, the computer is still seen as responsible for propagating an approach towards design that is superficial, apolitical, asocial and empty of content. For some, the computer is even seen as a potential threat to humanity itself. Alternatively, we might ask, is the absence of any substantive theory of digital design the result of a crisis in the world of theory itself? Have we encountered, as Michael Speaks has claimed, the ‘death of theory’? Or does Speaks’s position amount simply to an ‘anti-theory theory’? Or has architectural theory simply mutated into a different form that has been absorbed within architectural design to become a form of ‘design intelligence’? If so, could that new design intelligence be perceived as a new form of theory? And could the domain of digital design be capable of generating an entirely new form of architectural theory?     This course will attempt to address these questions. And it will attempt to address them not from the outside - from the position, say, of an art historian - but from within the world of architectural design itself, and from a position informed from working on actual computational design projects. The course will cover a range of topics, including digital culture, digital design, digital urbanism, digital fabrication and interactive design. It will look at material as diverse as biomimetic discourses inspired by nature, such as Swarm Intelligence, and robotic fabrication technologies for 3D printing structures on the Moon and Mars. On occasions, guest speakers from local institutions, such as Harvard University’s Wyss Institute or the MIT Media Lab will be invited to contribute to the course, and it is also hoped to include a few site visits. This course does not assume any prior knowledge of digital design techniques, and does not include tutorials on the actual use of digital design tools.   </p>",

We will concentrate on two branches of the discipline that have emerged since the 1970s. Both cultural and feminist geographers focus on space as a social construct made up of social relations, and constituted through material practices, and have also extended this reconceptualization to an understanding that spaces have a material effect of their own.</p><p>Part of geography's value for architecture has to do with feminism's role in the process of the discipline's epistemological redefinition. As part of Western culture, architecture like geography has taken for granted its basis in the naturalized alignments of masculine culture and feminine nature, wherein science has been presented as the objective agent for the revelation of an already existing \"transparent\" order of space. Feminist geographers argue that the ways in which traditional patriarchal conceptions of gender are deeply embedded in existing spaces. To the extent that these conceptions go unrecognized they also constitute a hindrance to our understanding of the spaces that we are still creating.</p><p>Addressing issues of subjectivity, landscape, and space in terms of construction and representation, geographical writing constitutes a critical resource for architectural thought. However, geographers rarely associate these issues with problems of making that architects must deal with every day. What are the productive challenges that a geographical discourse offers to architecture? Alternatively, how might architecture extend geography's discourse on social-spatial realities? The seminar offers access to current geographical writing, in a university without a geography department. Each class meeting will focus on a particular topic, including scale, location, subject, nature, gender, and representation. Students will draw on seminar texts to produce a mapping of a space or group of spaces, in two- and three-dimensional visual representations.</p>",

Based on its use and potential for sharing, it relates to social conditions and programming. It also lessens the economic burden of places. This seminar considers the environmental impact of buildings, infrastructures, and systems, from multiple angles. For example, from the perspective of structures, we will study the weight of buildings. We will look at a structure’s impact on energy consumption and its carbon foot print. We will also examine resource use. We will examine at how its allocation affects lessening environmental burdens through the study of materials, fabrication, assembly, and program.</p> <p>The concept of lightness, its perception and meaning, has been studied within various cultural contexts, such as literature and film. These medias have ascribed its meaning and value. We will also question building typology. From housing and concert hall typologies, to cultural centers and education facilities, we will see if mobility, temporality, and nomadic programing can be used to produce a new paradigm. This potential may encourage seasonal or shared use. Light structure also deals with perception of transparency and release from gravity. Design techniques that incorporate light and weightlessness is also an area of exploration. When the lightness of a structure is considered, economy of means and efficiency becomes an issue. There are many ways that one can contribute toward lightness through innovations. One can consider the scale and efficiency of its use, as well as how multiple tasks can be handled by fewer elements, techniques, and engineering. </p> <p>The seminar starts from a particular point of view, reconsidering and questioning known premises and conventions of architecture. Through inquiry and analysis, it attempts to uncover the interrelationships of function and structure. Through rigorous examination, it reexamines the role of architecture in our complex society. </p> <p>This seminar is a yearlong study of Light Structure; spanning the fall of 2014 and spring 2015. Students can select either or both courses. </p> <p>The fall semester will focus on: analysis, survey, historical inquiry, theory, and the technology of light structures. We will also question conventional building typologies and consider how one can transform them into light structures. We will create a new paradigm for building typology. </p> <p>The spring semester will be a series of workshops wherein students will develop models, prototypes, detailed studies, and mockups. Specifically, we will focus on membrane and textile based structures; owing to the course’s collaborative sponsor, Taiyo Kogyo. This Japan-based company is one of the largest membrane manufactures in the world. They specialize in deployment, assembly, and reassembly transportation logistics. Through Taiyo Kogyo, we will be able to test concepts, techniques, and fabrication prototypes.  </p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>In the past decades, design has branched out in many new directions that have galvanized emerging practitioners, sparked business models, and set the worldwide education system on academic fire. There are numerous different ways in which one can be a designer today, working for instance on interactions, interfaces, the Web, visualizations, biological entities, typefaces, socially-minded infrastructures, 5D spaces, sustainability, games, critical scenarios, and yes, even products and furniture. This seminar will examine contemporary modes of working within the field of design, from centers to peripheries, in order to understand the current landscape and its future pathways.</p> <p>The topics might be broken down into areas such as:</p> <p>Visualization  Visualization design has existed since the beginning, a direct expression of our desire to understand, describe and bring complex phenomena down to human scale. </p> <p>Brand Design  Brand design is not only the art of giving image and personality to corporations and products, but also the form of design that is devoted to communication.</p> <p>Thinkering  In 2007, John Seely Brown introduced the concept of Thinkering, or \"thinking with your hands.\" </p> <p>Critical Design  Following in the footsteps of radical design and architecture from the late 1960s and 1970s, Critical Design focuses on studying the impact and possible consequences of new technologies and policies, and of worldwide social and environmental trends, as well as on outlining new goals and areas of interest for designers.</p> <p>Organic Design  The study and application of the norms and forms of nature has been bundled for centuries under the label of \"organic design\", a broad term that embraces such diverse examples as Art Nouveau, some examples of robotics, biomimetic objects, etc. Contemporary organic design incorporates nature in new ways.</p> <p>In Your Face  Type design follows the history of the design of objects and buildings throughout the centuries, similarly reflecting social developments, advances in materials and means of production, cultural biases and technological progress. </p> <p>Bio-design  Bio-designers are turning their attention to familiar organisms like plants and animals. In some cases they examine the less accessible world of bacteria and cells, while in others they pursue the creation of new living systems by directly manipulating DNA. </p> <p>The Chair  Chairs are the staple of design, one of the first categories of objects (together with cars) that people all over the world think of when confronted with the \"D\" word. </p> <p>\"Green\" Design  Sustainability is commonly perceived as the antithesis of indulgence. But is environmental responsibility really all about renouncing enjoyment, lightness and humor? A new breed of designers is finding ways to combine ideological commitments with life’s pleasures.</p> <p>Social Design  Motivated by an ideal of equality, the dedication with which architects and designers strive to achieve even small improvements in living conditions opens up new perspectives.</p> <p>Radical Crafts  While designers were grappling with 3D printing, objects' lifecycles and recycles, footprints and Linden dollars, crafts have quietly pervaded not only the discussion but also the practice of design. </p> <p>Quantum Design  The best contemporary design follows the speculative and generative frameworks of quantum physics.   </p>",

The verse may serve as a doubly apt epigraph for a seminar devoted to the past, present, and future of the library as an institution. Apt because the first half has ornamented many a façade of a European library over the course of the past five centuries. Apt also because we live in an age in which digital forms of communication and media are quite literally exploding the prior culture of memory, with the demise of the printed book and the traditional library now a frequent topic of discussion.  What form should the library of the 21st century assume? Should it simply vanish into virtual desktops and merge into a timeless and placeless universal database? Should it adopt a double identity, bridging the worlds of print and digital documents, of physical presence and telepresence? Should it alter its identity and become a workshop, a laboratory, an innovation incubator where emerging and future forms interact and dialogue with the relics of the past? Or should it simply merge with the university itself as a place of knowledge production and reproduction? If so, where then should books \"go\" in the 21st century? And how about all the other \"old media\" that make up the record of human civilizations?  Informed answers to such questions require an understanding of libraries themselves, the practices that have shaped them, their systems of access, retrieval, and storage. For libraries are not just collections of documents and books, but also physical structures and, for that matter, infrastructures. Indeed, libraries are among the most venerable of building types, dating back to the ancient Near East. Their history is also that of cataloguing systems, vault and case designs, carrels and desks, viewing devices, lecterns, and the like.  <b>Bibliotheca</b> combines exploration of the history of the library as an institution of knowledge storage, retrieval and production with a design studio concerned with problem sets involving libraries on the Harvard campus as well as questions the future shape and functions of the library as an institution. The seminar is divided into three sections: the first is devoted to the history of libraries and library infrastructures; the second to case studies of major contemporary library projects; the third to brainstorming about design solutions to the real-world problems being confronted by the Harvard libraries.  Topics will include: libraries in the cultural imagination, library infrastructures from registers to card catalogues to digital catalogues, the history of shelving systems and lecterns, library architectures from the Library of Alexandria to the Digital Public Library of America.  </p>",

We see this in the extensive influence of television on daily life; in the presence of national newspapers that can boast some of the highest circulation numbers in the world; in the ubiquity of smartphones in places like the lecture hall or on the train; and in a highly-developed print culture rivalling that of any modern Western country. Media, as a topic, provides us with a vital starting point for a study of Japanese society. Furthermore, the study of the connections between Japan and media informs our larger understanding of the role these media have played in Korea, China, and other parts of modern Asia. This seminar will focus on the study of eleven cultural fields whose development is indivisible from the larger development of media in Japan. These fields are: print and publishing; the poster; the telephone; the camera; the movie theater; television; advertisements; the fair/exposition; the department store; the university; and the archive. We will examine the emergence and transformations of these fields in the context of modern Japan. At the same time, through an examination of a number of concrete examples, we will consider theoretical and empirical approaches for connecting media studies to disciplines like history and sociology. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged and expected to “attack” the ideas presented by the professor during the seminar or in the readings. Structured critiques of the professor’s ideas will be a central part of this seminar’s structure. Such a practice, it is hoped, can serve to reclaim a “revolutionary” creativity, in an academic sense, for the modern university.</p>",

In this part of the course we will practice a range of approaches to reading poems, considering a poem’s form alongside its cultural function, surveying the diverse and changing media and formats in which poems circulate--manuscript, performance, print, aural recording, performance;&nbsp; individual volume,&nbsp; general circulation magazine or newspaper,&nbsp; literary quarterly,&nbsp; schoolbook, gift book, psalter and more.&nbsp; Excursions may include visits to First Parish or Memorial Church, to Mt Auburn Cemetery and the Washington’s Headquarters and the Longfellow House. In the second 2/3 of the course we will focus on 20th century Harvard and its writers , with particular attention to 4 Harvard inflected moments in American literary history—the emergence of Modernism (&nbsp; with attention to Robinson, Du Bois, Frost,&nbsp; Reed,&nbsp; Stevens, Cullen); the rise of the&nbsp; New Criticism in the 1950’s&nbsp; (its standard bearers Eliot and Lowell ); the critique of New Criticism and rise of counter movements, New York School, Black Mountain, Beat Language,&nbsp; L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (from O’Hara, Ashbery, Koch, Creeley to Hejinian, Bernstein, Howe ) ; and, finally, Harvard and Radcliffe’s role in fostering poets from Gertrude Stein, Elizabeth Bishop&nbsp; through June Jordan and Adrienne Rich. Our 20th century studies will take us to the Woodberry Poetry Room, to Houghton and Schlesinger libraries, and students in the seminar will make their own contribution to Harvard's long poetic tradition by filming individual and group readings and interpretations of American poems for inclusion in the Poetry in America MOOC and other online outlets.</p>",

In this freshman seminar, we will utilize Houghton’s extraordinary holdings to study first-hand the history of the book in the West as a material artifact from its beginnings in the ancient Near East down to the present day. Each week we will focus upon a cluster of books.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before class, students will be asked to examine selected books in Houghton’s Reading Room as well as online.&nbsp;&nbsp; During class-time, we will study the books again as a group. Visiting experts will demonstrate how to unroll a papyrus codex, the technology involved in creating a codex and printing on a hand-pulled press, and the techniques modern conservators use to preserve manuscripts and books. You will emerge from this seminar with a heightened understanding of what a rich thing a book is, and so much more than just a text. And you will have seen and studied close-up some of the most visually spectacular and culturally significant books in all Western history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",

But do you even know what a “book” is? Is it merely a conveyor, a platform, for presenting a text? Can a book have a use other than being read? Does the nature of the material artifact inscribed with words shape or influence the way you understand their meaning? Do people read a scroll differently than they do a book with pages? Or a digital text on a screen? Why does the physical book persist in the digital age? To answer these questions, we will focus upon “the book of books,” namely, the Bible, as it has changed and developed in Jewish and Christian tradition over the last two thousand years. This course is not about the Bible but about the book. The reason we will use the Bible as our primary example of a book is simply because it has undergone more changes as a material artifact than any other book in Western culture. Furthermore, its own impact upon Western book culture has been greater than that of any other book. We will make regular use of the manuscripts and rare printed books in Houghton Library. Direct contact with books as material objects will be the focus of the course.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>We are told that print is dead. But the codes and processes of printmaking continue to shape contemporary art, culture, and technology in powerful ways. The most basic physical fact of printing -- its use of pressure in the creation of images and texts -- makes it an ideal tool for confronting questions of oppression and resistance. The collaborative qualities of printmaking are models for new understandings of distributed creativity and intelligence. The image reversals that occur in all print processes open ways of thinking about the world from a critical perspective, approaching it from \"the other side.” Even the most advanced digital information technologies draw on the traditions of print in fundamental ways. This course will provide an introduction to printmaking processes and will trace the life of print in art of every medium since 1960. Along with the lectures, there will be frequent study sessions with original works in the Harvard Art Museums, and hands-on print workshops. Artists covered will include (among many others) Robert Rauschenberg, Glenn Ligon, Christiane Baumgartner, Andy Warhol, Ellen Gallagher, Julie Mehretu, Edgar Heap of Birds, Willie Cole, Corita Kent, Richard Hamilton, Ed Ruscha, and Jasper Johns.&nbsp;</p>",

We will follow the trope of line, the most basic drawing mark, not to construct a linear history of the medium, but to provide a selective account of its uses, purposes, and functions as an instrument of modernity--or, as the case may be, of anti-modernity. Focusing on the period spanning the eighteenth century to the present, we will approach drawing not as a monolithic entity, but as a heterogenous phenomenon. We will consider it as a medium, a practice, an object, and a concept, and explore its interaction with, and cross-pollination by, other mediums and practices, (e.g., prints, photography; dance). We will discuss diverse approaches to draftsmanship–e.g., chronometric, kinetic, embodied, sculptural, automatic, blinded, black–and different modes of practice, (studio vs. urban drawing), and acquaint ourselves with procedures, techniques and materials by using them ourselves. We will also participate in a life drawing class in order to get a better sense of what the practice entails and what it makes possible.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convened in the Harvard Art Museums study room, the seminars will offer students a hands-on experience of the works of art combined with the discussion of the assigned readings. In an effort to assess as well as reimagine the role of drawing, students will be encouraged to experiment with the format of their final project: aside from the classic research paper, annotated drawing series, an exhibition project, a film, a podcast and other inventive modes of presenting an argument will be welcome.

Students will study a wide range of verbal and visual texts produced over a thousand-year span throughout Europe, including commentaries and histories, sermons and saints' lives, eschatological plays and visionary poetry, illustrated Apocalypse manuscripts and early printed books, and sculpture and stained glass. The course concludes by contrasting the medieval tradition with the new interpretations, polemical uses, and cultural representations of the Apocalypse introduced during the Protestant Reformation.</p>",

Combined with the changed historiography, the past decade has witnessed new approaches to ornamental planting design.

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>“What does it mean to exhibit architecture?”  Exhibitions are an integral part of the history of architecture. While architecture entered the gallery during the Enlightenment, first in London around 1760, and later in Paris and Berlin, a significant step was taken in the early twentieth century when Philip Johnson, meeting Alfred H. Barr Jr., the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, suggested “why not include architecture”; marking the creation of the first collection of architecture within an art museum. &nbsp;In the late 1970s, architecture entered the Venice Biennale a decision that soon gave rise to the multiplication of architecture Biennials and Triennials and other large-scale exhibitions, expanding even further the ‘exhibitionary’ complex within the discipline.  Yet, as it is well known, exhibiting architecture is a paradoxical act of radical deracination. It is difficult not to say impossible to present architecture within the space of the gallery without representing or translating it into simulacra and other forms of representation – into drawings, models, prints, photographs, digital format, films, books and other objects.  This seminar invites students to explore the historical and theoretical conditions but also the political and institutional contexts under which architecture exhibitions are produced and consumed. Looking at exhibiting architecture beyond mere representation and starting from the hypothesis that architects, through the act of “exhibiting”, exert different forms of agency on and beyond the building site, this seminar will explore how exhibitions have been a critical site for exchange and competition, spatial experimentation, research, performance and protest as well as the construction of national identities.  Through a close reading of some of the most seminal texts with regards to the theory and history of exhibiting architecture we will study specific historical and contemporary examples of architecture exhibitions. We will see how during the cold war, cultural exchanges and competitions played out at international exhibitions. We will look at the questions of the curator as an author and creative figure while exploring new ways of displaying narratives (through timelines, dioramas and panoramas) and scrutinize the means and motivations behind architecture’s inclusion into the museum. We will also investigate the rise of “activist” exhibitions and the inclusion of performance as a new means of interacting with the built environment.  Each week, lectures and reading analysis, followed by practical exercises and visits, will allow us to move through different agencies of display. In parallel, students will be asked to produce a curatorial project that will be presented during our last session. The evaluation will be based on student’s active participation to the course (30%) and their final project and presentation (70%).  This course will include the participation of guest lecturers Véronique Patteeuw and Marina Otero Verzier.  Enrolment in this course was pre-selected via early lottery. It is limited to students enrolled in the GSD Rotterdam Study Abroad Program.</p>",

We will consider whether technologies like robotics, platforms, 3D printing, and platforms can be harnessed toward producing arrangements conducive to broad-based economic security. Can technology be a complete or partial solution? Can it be integrated with cooperative, commons-based, non-profit, municipal, or entrepreneurial models to offer systemic solutions?</p>",

The integration of design and development will be emphasized in proposals that respond to realistic market demand, economic feasibility, and other regulatory constraints, while offering bold new configurations for large urban projects in the American city. This seminar will combine students from a range of disciplines in an immersive investigation of architecture, urban design and development focusing on three areas: 1. the exploration of cultural centers as urban generators in comparable cities 2. a critical review of emerging housing morphologies appropriate to the context and 3. an understanding of the potential role of catalytic open space interventions in the restructuring of large urban districts. These three areas of research will culminate in a design proposal for four large scale sites adjacent to the Arts District in Dallas, Texas. With new cultural institutions under construction in the District by OMA and Richard Rogers (as well as the recently completed Nasher Sculpture Gallery by Renzo Piano, and landscape design by Michel Desvigne) the challenge is to transform a collection of significant buildings into a more variegated urban environment with the addition of residential fabric, open space networks and attendant programs. </p><p> <b>Student requirements</b> The students will visit Dallas for 3-5 days in the first week of March. They will meet with stakeholders as well as the sponsors, local developers, brokers, civic leaders, and government officials to get the best possible understanding of the site, the downtown, the strategic goals and growth plans for the city.  </p><p> Throughout the course of the semester, students will be expected to create a development plan for the study site that includes specific design proposals and financial plans under the guidance of the instructors and through regular contact with the sponsors. Students will make a final presentation using both slides and printed material to a jury at the mid-term and at the end of the term.  </p><p> Students will then prepare a final report for the instructors that will also be sent to the Sponsors of the field study. Representatives from each of the teams will also travel to Dallas in May to present their results to the stakeholders in conjunction with the Harvard Symposium, Good Design Makes Good Business. </p>",

In the discourse of modern architecture and urbanism, the study of building typologies often functions as a useful methodology to interpret the condensed interrelationship between the physical attributes of building forms and spatial representation of social and cultural forces of a society. The purpose of this course is, once again, taking this methodology, to offer a necessary perspective for the linkage between the physicality of design practice and the operational perspective of the market economy, specifically, the capital markets (Wall Street). It aims to enable students to understand how building typologies can serve as intersections of design prototypes, real estate products, and commodities of capital investment in the context of physical planning/design of urban form.  Through lectures, slide presentations, readings, and case studies, this course will survey four prototypes of real estate development/investments: residential (single- and multi-family housing), retail, office and mixed use. Students will learn the critical principles of different building typologies' design trajectories, dimensional requirements, compositional patterns, and ordering considerations, as well as the practicality of these physical attributes in the eyes of other active participants in the building environment, particularly developers and capital investors. The focus also will be on the physical patterns that the building types embody at the level of the urban context: the neighborhood, the street, and the site.  The course is intended for both designers and non-designers, to acquaint them with a perspective that incorporates and goes beyond the formality of design associated with each of the product types. The relationship between design aesthetics and economic viability of buildings will be central to the course - how design creates value for investors, owners, and tenants of real estate, as well as the society at large, and how the architectural/urban morphological power contributes to the success of economic performance and operations as units of the market economy.   </p>",

What happens to the poet’s language?); and poetry and the other arts (how have music, film, drama, paintings, photography, and the philosophical essay been felt in poetry? can poems become visual artifacts, or scripts for performance?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Examples from the work of Aygi, Brodsky, Dragomoshchenko, Goralik, Glazova, Kaminsky, Khlebnikov, Mandelstam, Mnatsakanova, Nabokov, Pushkin, Sedakova, Slutsky, Vvedensky.

From his library the <em>hidalgo</em>, bent on writing himself into History, sallies forth into a world of actors, storytellers, and readers. How do books come by their power to shape individuals and their world? We read Cervantes' masterpiece alongside seminal Renaissance works his characters and readers knew (Erasmus, Vives, More, Castiglione), and modern studies of reading and print culture. Conducted in Spanish; an advanced reading knowledge of Spanish is essential. There will be class visits to the Houghton Library of Rare Books and screenings of film versions of the novel.&nbsp;</p>",

Galicia is a region in Spain characterized by a more fragmented occupation of its territory.

The project forms a part of a more ambitious plan, which seeks to recuperate the waterfront, at least in the parts more urbanized and populated, into a place of parks and leisure facilities. To this end, precise urban planning directives have been established, which will constitute the urban guidelines for the project. The program proposes and intervention of some 5000 square meters and also includes the treatment of the park and the waterfront.

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>Collaborative and interdisciplinary in spirit, this sponsored studio will explore the design potentials of an emerging set of soft, flexible polymer technologies that deliver and transmit information, light and energy. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and flexible micro-electronics may be integrated into pliant natural and synthetic material hosts such as gels, rubber, neoprene, silicone, and a wide variety of 3-D knit fabrics and textiles. These soft materials offer a new integration media for flexible photo-voltaics, displays, antennas and other receptors, sensors (switches) and microprocessor controls. Converging with the current growth of wireless data and communications networks, flexible OLED technologies challenge conventional categories of infrastructure, fixture, appliance and furnishings-with significant implications for basic elements of architecture such as wall types, windows, structural and enclosure systems. This nano technology is miniaturized and lightweight, autonomous yet interconnected and personal in it's proximity to the body. Printed, embedded or woven into the surfaces of daily life, convenient and available when needed, flexible technologies can become material artifacts of architecture-- performative and dynamic, changing over time. The role of materiality takes on a renewed importance as the interface between the physical and digital realms can become increasingly tactile, tangible and sensual.   Students in this studio will consider the dynamic performance of OLED polymers as material phenomena that influence the perception of space. The trajectory of the studio will advance from an understanding of the technology and its material effects towards the design of an architecture of material affect-- the choreography of a space that moves. Resisting the temptations of the assumed \"realism\" of digital animation, the studio will focus on the selection and elaboration of key perspectives and orthographic projections to describe the material and spatial characteristics of surface hood in the students' designs. The studio will explore a language of representation that uses drawings as abstract and deliberate representational tool to describe the spatial predicaments of a temporal materiality: the dissolve, the transition states between material conditions, the physical deformation of giving surfaces, and the succession of multiple material readings. Using the design of a spatial choreography as a catalyst, students will explore how wireless infrastructure and soft hi-performance polymers may introduce new formal organizations and programmatic possibilities for program typologies in education such as the classroom, library, student dormitory and public commons space.   During the course of the semester, students will develop designs for cross over applications where flexible technologies are integrated into soft surfaces that operate between the scales of the body, the building, and the city. With energy efficient, low voltage micro-circuits, flexible polymers offer highly effective potentials for affordable photo-voltaic power generation and storage with mobile and exterior applications in architecture. Students will develop these potentials in design concepts for solar powered surfaces of light and information that cross over between needs associated with the \"developed\" and \"developing\" worlds. In this way, the studio responds to fundamental human needs by offering innovative, effective and affordable designs that provide the economic basis to accelerate the pace of a broader global cultural adaptation of these energy efficient materials. Student projects may include designs for interactive fabrics, upholstery, wall claddings, furniture, facades, roof surfaces and building envelopes, as well as designs and value propositions for an evolving new class of soft surfaces and mobile objects that constitute the space of this extended architectural and urban landscape.  </p>",

The task involves two specific problems: a program of high complexity, and cultural surroundings probably unfamiliar to the studio participants (Sweden).   The assignment. Two parks are about to be built in the City of Malmv, southern Sweden. Malmv is the third largest urban concentration in Sweden and in May 2000 was connected with the neighboring country Denmark with a bridge16 km long. This put an end to a fifty year long discussion of how to physically link the two countries together. The Malmv region now feels a great optimism and has hopes of prosperity. For the first time Malmv turns away from the north -- and the capital Stockholm -- and instead faces the south, Denmark and Europe.  On landfill at the edge of the sea of Vresund a new extension of the city, with 700 housing units, will be built. Inauguration will be in May 2001 and the whole undertaking will be exhibited as an architecture exposition called Bo01. Important ingredients in this new part of the city are two major parks: the Seashore Park and the Canal Park. They have been the subject of an international competition with five invited design teams.  In this studio, the students will design a schematic for both parks and a complete design for one (optional) of these parks. At the close of the final critique, the competition entries will be presented and discussed. One of these entries will also have been realized at about the date of the studio ending.  Pedagogic objectives: To develop synthetic thinking and design aspects of the field of landscape architecture: First is the ability to grasp the features of the place. Ecology, social use, representation, site-memory, maintenance and project economy all derive from an unconditional demand to understand the place, its history, identity and character. To investigate and present proposals for a site which is now programmed for new, altered, or restored functions is an effective method for gaining additional skill in understanding a place.  The problem of unfamiliarity. Site analysis and design work develop more easily with greater familiarity with a given situation. The more unfamiliar the place, the more it requires an empathic and versatile designer to understand its origin as well as its future. To put ourselves as designers into such an insecure position, however, requires that we sharpen our ability to identify differences, to see contradictions, to work with unfamiliar juxtapositions.  The problem of complexity. Urban spaces offer among the most complicated design problems encountered by designers. Urban spaces often possess a disrupted and changing history, many times hidden and layered. Urban spaces often have a complex utilization by many social groups -and individuals--, sometimes with conflicting interests. Urban spaces often have a high intensity per given area unit and, thus, they provide a classic task for the landscape architect.  Yet urban spaces often suffer from dullness; they are often mono-functional, artificial in the bad sense of the word, and they provoke little curiosity or interest. It seems, on the other hand, that nature or/and natural features more often succeed in being sympathetic places-especially in Scandinavia. It partly has to do with the landscape architect4s unability to cope with the situation of high complexity, partly with cultural sensitivities.  Initiation. The studio will begin with the development of a \"landscape grammar.\" This point of departure will trace the history of some landscape keywords: path, water feature, forest and glade. We will study and describe the shifts and use of these words during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  The park design will then offer possibilities for the interpretation of these units in a more complex situation in the 21st century. Our concerns </p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>In most design paradigms, it is the chunks of landscape space that receive the primacy of our attention, while the linear strips of space are overlooked, under appreciated and marginalized. For too long the hegemony of the chunk has dominated the space and structure of the strip. Chunks are the privileged location for signification because they connote place; while the strips are a conveyance, invested with transitory content. This defies the reality of much contemporary landscape architectural production, which is increasingly occupied with and occurring in the margin of left-over spaces, in-between areas, or along-side conditions. It is a misconception to presume that content lies solely in the sign of the chunk and not in the structure of the strip.This studio will focus on design investigations into the typology of linear spaces. Frequently linear spaces co-habit with infrastructure. They occur in landscapes of all scale; urban and rural; new sites and reused. Linear spaces result from discrete as well as systematic conditions. They are sometimes an occurrence of natural or geological events, but frequently they result from cultural conditions, incidents and needs. One very common type of linear space is the connection and linkage that occurs between other spaces; a street or passageway for instance. Linear spaces often exist as the left-over gaps, joints, or compressed spaces that remain between objects or places. Frequently, linear spaces are the marginal areas surrounding something else; ubiquitous insulating strips of ill-defined buffer zones. Intentionality is the operative and crucial issue. Linear landscapes present spatially and conceptually difficult situations; they pose challenging organizational problems and require specialized design approaches and solutions. Linear landscapes merit their own partis, strategic and tactical approaches and distinctive design vocabularies. This studio will be particularly interested in exploring opportunistic strategies which are often operational in contested urban space. The studio will involve readings and a parallel investigation into related disciplines to further an understanding of issues of medium, linear structure, duration, and movement relative to the design of physical space. This studio will study several linear sites, all in New York City. Each site will present different scale, program and contextual issues. Preliminary selection of sites include: a small contained linear open space; a mile long park corridor sandwiched between two neighborhoods; and a linear river edge site. Students from all GSD programs are welcome. There will be one field trip to New York City.</p>",

They have been the subject of an international competition with five invited design teams.  In this studio, the students will design a schematic for both parks and a complete design for one (optional) of these parks. At the close of the final critique, the competition entries will be presented and discussed. One of these entries will also have been realized at about the date of the studio ending.  Pedagogic objectives: To develop synthetic thinking and design aspects of the field of landscape architecture: First is the ability to grasp the features of the place. Ecology, social use, representation, site-memory, maintenance and project economy all derive from an unconditional demand to understand the place, its history, identity and character. To investigate and present proposals for a site which is now programmed for new, altered, or restored functions is an effective method for gaining additional skill in understanding a place.  The problem of unfamiliarity. Site analysis and design work develop more easily with greater familiarity with a given situation. The more unfamiliar the place, the more it requires an empathic and versatile designer to understand its origin as well as its future. To put ourselves as designers into such an insecure position, however, requires that we sharpen our ability to identify differences, to see contradictions, to work with unfamiliar juxtapositions.  The problem of complexity. Urban spaces offer among the most complicated design problems encountered by designers. Urban spaces often possess a disrupted and changing history, many times hidden and layered. Urban spaces often have a complex utilization by many social groups -and individuals--, sometimes with conflicting interests. Urban spaces often have a high intensity per given area unit and, thus, they provide a classic task for the landscape architect.  Yet urban spaces often suffer from dullness; they are often mono-functional, artificial in the bad sense of the word, and they provoke little curiosity or interest. It seems, on the other hand, that nature or/and natural features more often succeed in being sympathetic places-especially in Scandinavia. It partly has to do with the landscape architect4s unability to cope with the situation of high complexity, partly with cultural sensitivities.  Initiation. The studio will begin with the development of a \"landscape grammar.\" This point of departure will trace the history of some landscape keywords: path, water feature, forest and glade. We will study and describe the shifts and use of these words during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  The park design will then offer possibilities for the interpretation of these units in a more complex situation in the 21st century. Our concerns </p>",

Linear spaces result from discrete as well as systematic conditions.

One very common type of linear space is the connection and linkage that occurs between other spaces; a street or passageway for instance. Linear spaces often exist as the left-over gaps, joints, or compressed spaces that remain between objects or places. Frequently, linear spaces are the marginal areas surrounding something else; ubiquitous insulating strips of ill-defined buffer zones. Intentionality is the operative and crucial issue.

The format allows students to respond to lectures and course material as it is presented with  studio projects. The course addresses the issues of overall visual literacy and the ever changing role of the architect and planner. In  addition to the traditional elements of graphic design - typography, image use, color and production - reading, research, and critique  create a discourse on the effects of graphic design and a consideration of its meaning in a cultural context. History lectures and readings expose students to some of the overlaps, influences, and patterns in modern and contemporary design, while technical lectures explain basic production and printing procedures. Lectures include presentations of examples of magazine, catalogue, book, portfolio design, packaging, websites, and film and television titles.  Practical demonstrations show similar working methods to architecture, showing the consideration and presentation of ideas, the process of sketches, mock ups, revisions, materials, details, finish, manufacture, and production. The development and design of a research essay demonstrates the importance of integration of content and design. This final assignment concentrates student's efforts on the ability to edit and the importance of the assembly and the consideration of the presentation of projects.  Pedagogic Objective: To explore the culture and potential of graphic design, and to evaluate the ideas behind and created and engaged by it.  Time Commitment: Three hours of studio/lecture per week.  Basis of Final Grade: Quality of ideas and their execution and an evaluation of dedication of the student. Grades are based on two projects, a book report, and final essay document.</p>",

The objective of this course is to advance knowledge and design skills for cultural prosthetics by focusing on the conditions that arise in post-war life. While ergonomic requirements must be addressed, psycho-social needs must also be addressed through communication media.      According to trauma theorist and clinician Judith Herman the struggle for recovery from trauma by finding a narrative voice through testimony has a greater chance of success when performed as a public speech act - even more so when directed as a social utterance to and on behalf of others. </p> <p>“Public truth-telling” as social action has a psychologically restorative power. At the same time, it contributes to social justice and the democratic process.    In order to counter new forms of social alienation and “disarm” cultural prejudice, there must be the advancement of artistic methods for designing, developing, experimenting with and socially implementing devices that facilitate cross-cultural communication for veterans. </p> <p>Cultural prosthetics is a new techno-artistic and socio-aesthetic field that can inspire, encourage and assist this population by giving them methods for opening up and communicating with a greater public to the point of playful virtuosity.    Through the design of cultural prostheses, students will seek original responses to the social and psychological impact of present-day wars. The class will focus on the situation of war veterans and their families (who are war veterans in their own right), on the overwhelming experience of civilians caught in the theatre of war, and on society’s incomprehension of the emotional experiences of war.</p> <p>We will explore core questions surrounding the design, development, equipping and “fitting” of this new type of post-war prostheses. What is necessary for restoring a veteran’s emotional, cultural, and social life? Through design, how can communicative and performative techno-devices be combined and made usable to veterans and their families so that they may challenge their own forms of alienation?</p> <p>We will conduct ergonomic, psychological, and social research in collaboration with potential users and fabricators and will use creative software, 3D printing, physical modeling, and hardware design / integration (micro-projectors, display screens and other communication media devices).     The workshop will include visits to groups who are working on prosthetics, artificial intelligence, and robotics at Harvard, MIT’s Media Lab, and within the Boston area. There will also be the potential to meet with veterans groups and medical professionals who are advocating and developing new methods of treatment for psychologically and physically wounded soldiers and their families.</p>",

    "courseDescriptionLong": "<p>Vogue, Ms., Cosmopolitan, Working Mother– a visit to any newsstand or supermarket checkout line reveals countless magazines, with vastly different aims and content, intended primarily for women. This course explores the complex relationship between women—as authors, reviewers, readers, and consumers— and periodicals, beginning in the eighteenth century, when rising literacy rates ad advances in printing technology saw a huge rise in magazine circulation. Then, as now, magazines provided a platform for many women to share their writing; they also, however, often perpetuated problematic gender stereotypes and derogatory images of women. We will read pieces by and about important women writers, including Eliza Haywood, Mary Robinson, and Mary Wollstonecraft, as well as contextualizing materials, to consider questions such as: what differentiates a “women’s” (or “men’s”) magazine from any other kind of magazine? Are magazines inherently literary, inherently commercial, or both? How do magazines challenge or perpetuate popular discourses about the body? The class will have the opportunity to work with eighteenth- and nineteenth- century magazines in Harvard’s special collections, as well as completing research on contemporary magazines. Topics will include: anonymous authorship; travel writing; advertising and consumerism; popular culture; fashion and trends; and the rise of celebrity.</p>",
