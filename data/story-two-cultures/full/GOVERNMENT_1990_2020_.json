A wide range of problems in contemporary societies require innovation in the institutional arrangements of the market economy and of democratic politics. But the theory and practice of progressives has long been deficient in the imagination of institutional alternatives. They have wanted to humanize the market order by means of redistributive taxation and social spending; they have not known how to reshape it. Here we search for the structural vision and the alternative forms of economic and political organization that have remained beyond the horizon of contemporary politics and policy. Law and legal thought have special pertinence to this inquiry. Because they deal with institutional details, they speak to institutional possibilities. A major focus for our discussion this year will be the future of the knowledge economy. The most advanced, knowledge-intensive practice of production remains confined to vanguards of the economy, excluding the vast majority of the labor force. That confinement has become a powerful cause of economic stagnation and inequality.&nbsp; How can we overcome it and use its overcoming as an opportunity to democratize the market and to deepen democracy?

What should they propose, now that they no longer believe in the usefulness of governmental direction of the economy or in the sufficiency of redistributive social programs? A basic concern is the relation of programmatic thought to the understanding of change and constraint. In the recent historical period, progressives have sought to humanize the established order rather than to reimagine and remake it. &nbsp;Here the main focus is on institutional or structural change in the market system and in democratic politics. &nbsp;Among the themes to be discussed are the nature and future of the knowledge economy, the status of free labor vis-à-vis capital, the relation of finance to production, the making of a high-energy democracy that no longer needs crisis to make change possible, and the education required by such economic and political alternatives. &nbsp;A central theme throughout is the content and implications of the idea of freedom.

It has claimed to champion the interests of ordinary working men and women. It now finds itself disoriented. The disorientation concerns both its institutional proposals and its assumptions about the ideal and the possible. This course explores the meaning of this disorientation and the way it can be overcome. It does so both historically and programmatically: by exploring the rise and fall in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries of the idea of a progressive alternative to established institutions as well as by considering the directions the Left now takes, can take, and should take. The scope of the argument is worldwide, touching on the experience of richer as well as poorer countries. A central theme is the relation of programmatic thought to the understanding of change and constraints. Readings in social and political theory as well as in the literature of contemporary programmatic debates.

Alongside many enduring myths and misperceptions about terrorism, the history of this violent technique is rife with puzzles. Why is it so difficult for people to agree on a common definition of terrorism across the globe? Why do groups take up arms against civilians to effect political change? Why do some groups remain fairly restrained in their use of violence while others routinely engage in mass atrocities? Why do some terror groups end within a year of their emergence, whereas others toil along for decades? What are the most effective ways to combat terrorism? What is really “new” about the “new terrorism”? The course takes a theoretical and historical approach, attempting to nest contemporary challenges within the broader global context of terrorism as a phenomenon. To this end, the course will acquaint students with the historical evolution of domestic and international terrorism while introducing them to the major analytical approaches to the study of terrorism. The five primary goals of the course are for students to: (1) present leading theories, approaches, and concepts for understanding terrorist behavior around the globe; (2) evaluate current approaches to terrorism against prevailing evidence; (3) apply cumulative knowledge to current policy problems and make informed inferences about future developments; (4) deepen their knowledge about particular cases or topics regarding terrorism and counterterrorism; and (5) synthesize their knowledge during in-depth course discussions and several written assignments. By the end of the course, students should understand the fundamental analytical and policy debates surrounding terrorism globally, as well as several policy alternatives that may lead to solutions. Students should also develop substantive knowledge about current trends in terrorism and counterterrorism. By the end of the term, students should be comfortable taking an intellectual stand about topics related to terrorism, defending their positions with evidence, engaging in self-critique, deriving actionable policy recommendations, and communicating those recommendations to both specialist and non-specialist audiences—particularly when the empirical record contrasts with the conventional wisdom. Course assignments are designed to enhance those skills.</p>","year":2019},{"id":"1842","title":"Models of Conflict in International Relations","termName":"Spring","termYear":2016,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":109556,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course is both a simple introduction to game theory, and a literature review of game theoretical approaches to the study of international conflict and war.

We also show how it is easy to conceive original approaches and new statistical estimators when required. The specific models introduced will be chosen based on student research topics. In past years they have included models for event counts, ecological inference, time-series cross section analysis, compositional data, casual inference, and others. Government 2000 or the equivalent is usually (but not always) taken prior to 2001.

Course examines this body of research to clarify the pitfalls and possibilities of studying politics as a process which takes place over time. Among the themes to be explored are: ideas of path dependence and critical junctures in political development; techniques for studying the significance of timing and sequence in politics; and role of actors' time horizons_which may be long or short_in shaping political processes. Places considerable emphasis on recent theories of institutional origins, development and change, because institutions are perhaps the principal instruments through which previous politics shape current politics. Readings will include a wide range of empirical and theoretical writings drawn from all the subfields of political science.</p>","year":2001},{"id":"254129","title":"History, Institutions, and Political Analysis","termName":"Spring","termYear":2003,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":143396,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Drawing from all subfields of political science, this course examines theories and research designs attuned to issues of path dependence, historical sequence, timing, and temporal horizons.

The ancient Athenians invented an unusually successful type of political regime and were remarkably self-conscious about what they were trying to do and how and why it worked. An important feature of their democracy was a largely sustained openness to ideas. The execution of Socrates was the exception not the rule, and dissent thrived in Athens. The philosophical work of Plato and Aristotle did not occur in isolation of or separation from the politics of the city. To an important extent, the ancient critics of Athens were also trying to cure it of what they saw as its failings. A study of key ancient Greek thinkers as critics of the democracy shines valuable light on their political theory generally. Importantly, it is only with the moderns—the Federalist Papers, Constant, Mill, Berlin, and even Rawls—that we find purely apolitical and theoretical criticism of ancient Athens. Their target is the Athenian ideal of political equality. By extending our study of critics of Athenian democracy into the contemporary period, we gain new insight about the place of the ideal of political equality in contemporary democratic theory and theories of justice.</p>","year":2016},{"id":"82272","title":"Language and Politics","termName":"Fall","termYear":1991,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":113985,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Investigates a number of different conceptions of language and studies their political and historiographical implications, focusing on texts by Locke, Durkheim, Mill, Neitzsche, Wittgenstein, Austin, Skinner, Pocock, Derrida, and Habermas.</p>","year":1991.5},{"id":"154753","title":"Language and Politics","termName":"Spring","termYear":1997,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":113985,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Investigates a number of different conceptions of language and studies their political and historiographical implications, focusing on texts by Locke, Durkheim, Mill, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Austin, Skinner, Pocock, Derrida, and Habermas.</p>","year":1997},{"id":"69797","title":"Pluralism and Citizenship","termName":"Spring","termYear":1997,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":114130,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Examines some of the classic political theoretical texts on pluralism and citizenship in light of recent political and theoretical developments regarding such issues as nationalism, cosmopolitanism, feminism, immigration, migrant workers, multiculturalism in education, and the politics of sexuality.</p>","year":1997},{"id":"58886","title":"Contemporary Political Thought: Contract and Politics","termName":"Spring","termYear":1991,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":117171,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Examines the problems of politics of contracting and promising in political theory by focusing on the classical contract theory texts as well as on modern and contemporary works by Arendt, Derrida, Rawls, Nietzsche, and others.</p>","year":1991},{"id":"83872","title":"Pluralism and Citizenship","termName":"Spring","termYear":1996,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":114130,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Examines some of the classic political theoretical texts on pluralism and citizenship in light of recent political and theoretical developments regarding such issues as nationalism, cosmopolitanism, feminism, immigration, migrant workers, multiculturalism in education, and the politics of sexuality.</p>","year":1996},{"id":"230160","title":"American Political Thought","termName":"Fall","termYear":2004,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":118415,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>American political thought, with a focus on the period 1760-1865.

E. Schattschneider famously wrote that “Political parties created modern democracy and modern democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the parties.” When we survey the world’s democratic and semi-democratic polities, however, outside of the advanced industrial democracies, many have weak parties and inchoate party systems. In many countries, once powerful parties have disappeared. In other third and fourth wave democracies, solid parties underpin solid democracies, just as Schattschneider expected. What accounts for successful party building and for the institutionalization of a party system? What accounts for the collapse of major parties and even entire party systems? Why do parties remain weak in some democracies and semi-democracies? How does the institutionalization of parties under authoritarian rule affect the political regime? These are some of the questions we will grapple with.</p>","year":2017},{"id":"37324","title":"Politics and Political Economy in Japan","termName":"Fall","termYear":1998,"subjectDescription":"Government","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","subject":"GOV","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Government","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":131391,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Explores major issues in Japanese politics and political economy in historical and comparative perspective, including the role of the ruling party, bureaucracy, and big business in policymaking; the trade-offs of a ^'^'one-party dominant'' political system; the role of an opposition in such a system; and the international, sociocultural, economic, and political determinants of domestic policy choices.

The course begins with a foundational review of the different levels at which states interact and the primary theoretical paradigms in the field. It then addresses how states achieve cooperation in the face of international anarchy. The course next addresses basic bargaining theory, which uses insights from economics to explore how bargaining breakdowns, commitment problems, and incomplete information can lead to war.
