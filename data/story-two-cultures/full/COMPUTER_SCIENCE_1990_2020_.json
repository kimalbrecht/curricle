technological paradigm shifts in computing of the past decade. The next major paradigm shift in computer networking will be the emergence of 5G wireless mobile networks, which will begin to replace the current 4G networks as early as 2019/2020. These further advancements in wireless networking are expected to transform the technological landscape over the next decade by enabling an endless possibility of new applications, including the Internet of Things and wireless virtual reality, through the emergence of wireless networks with gigabit speeds. In order to play a role in this era of new network-powered advancements, students must have a thorough understanding of emerging networking topics, especially in the wireless domain. Rather than teaching the basic networking protocols, which have become very mature and can be treated as a black box, in CS 143, we will teach the new issues and topics of interest, which will power important emerging applications. This focus on upcoming wireless advancements and mobile applications is the motivation for CS 143 this semester. The class will be organized into the following nine modules: A View of the Future: 5G—A World with Gigabit Wireless Networking; Basic Networking Concepts; Fundamental Radio Propagation Physics; Basic Wireless Networking Concepts: Wi-Fi, MAC protocols; New Fundamentals of Mobile Networking: 5G Millimeter Wave, Ultra Dense Networks (UDNs); Advanced Topics in 5G: Beam Forming, MIMO; 5G System Infrastructure: Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networking; 5G Applications: The Internet of Things and Massive Machine Type Communications; and Machine Learning Assisted Networking.

These new networks are software defined in the sense that they can be dynamically programmed to meet various communications needs in computing. In CS 144r/244r, students will obtain the knowledge and experience necessary not only to understand this momentous technological shift in networking, but also to be able to play a part themselves. To this end, the course will not only teach the fundamental concepts necessary to understand this emerging field of software-defined networking, but also real world applications of the technologies such as next-generation ultra-dense 5G cellular networks, as well as their connection with complementary topics such as machine learning. The class will be organized into the following eight modules: A View of the Future: The Promise of Next Generation Networking; Basic Network Design and Protocols; Datacenter Design and Networking; Software Defined Networking; Cross-Disciplinary Applications of Next Generation Networking: Machine Learning, Distributed Computing, and Consumer Applications; Wireless Networking: 5G Networks and Millimeter Wave Communication; Connecting the Internet of Things; Next Generation Networking Enabled Infrastructure: Network Function Virtualization. Students will gain mastery of the subject through lectures, programming assignments, discussion of the latest networking literature, and a final project. Students will have wide latitude in designing and implementing a final project they are passionate about.

In many of these processes the actual steps taken by biological systems are not currently understood. Further, even the outcomes that are being realized by these processes are not well understood. In general current understanding of most aspects of biology is not complete or specific enough to provide theories in which predictions can be made by analysis or computer simulation. Computer science is the study of step by step processes and of specifications of the outcomes that such processes can realize. For many computational outcome specifications it is known or believed that no mechanism with feasible resources can realize them. Computer science therefore offers a top-down approach to understanding what could possibly be computed in biology, and how. In this course we shall pursue this computational complexity approach, whose origins go back to Turing and von Neumann.

The big challenge is how to turn data into useful knowledge. This&nbsp;is a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect data evolve. In this class, we discuss how to design data systems,&nbsp;data structures, and algorithms for key data-driven areas, including relational systems, distributed systems, graph systems, noSQL, newSQL,&nbsp;machine learning, and neural networks. We see how they all rely on the same set of very basic concepts and we learn how to synthesize efficient&nbsp;solutions for any problem across these areas using those basic concepts.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"225191","title":"Database Systems","termName":"Fall","termYear":2004,"subjectDescription":"Computer Science","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Computer Science","subject":"COMPSCI","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":113660,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>A research-oriented introduction to Database Management systems.

Cyberspace is a unique combination of physical and virtual properties. In this course, we view cyberspace as a structure consisting of three layers:&nbsp; the physical layer represented by the global communication infrastructure and two virtual layers, composed by the Internet layer and the social and economic layer.&nbsp; Our focus concentrates on the&nbsp; top two layers. The principles, norms, rules, and procedures that shape the cyberspace are studied in this course through quantitative analysis of data collected from different sources in the digital world.&nbsp; Data-oriented analysis of problems and policies in cyberspace will be illustrated by examining several case studies in the major internet platforms. The case studies will help students to understand the role of social algorithms, programs that rank and classify people and information&nbsp; and services that provide customized experiences.&nbsp; Ultimately, students learn how to use quantitative methods to understand different issues related to digital governance.</p>","year":2016.5},{"id":"34266","title":"Applied Ethical and Governance Challenges in AI","termName":"Spring","termYear":2019,"subjectDescription":"Computer Science","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Computer Science","subject":"COMPSCI","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Computer Science","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":203579,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course will pursue a cross-disciplinary investigation of the development and deployment of the opaque complex adaptive systems that are increasingly in public and private use.
