How can a show that&nbsp;presents&nbsp;so many talented artists of color&nbsp;represent&nbsp;a white-washed American history? And how should we evaluate the show’s impact when sky-high ticket prices make it accessible primarily to a wealthy (read: white) audience? In its aspirational embrace of a multi-ethnic America and its failure fully to realize that promise,&nbsp;Hamiltonembodies the paradox of Broadway. This course examines that paradox since World War II, particularly as it pertains to multiple aspects of identity including race, gender, sexuality, and disability. We will examine how shows such as&nbsp;South Pacific, with its famous anti-racist anthem, or&nbsp;M. Butterfly, which explored the intersections of Orientalism, gender, and sex, temper their inclusive representations to appeal to wide commercial audience. Broadway is a particularly fertile ground for exploring these issues because theatrical performances always call attention to the performative nature of subjectivity: that is, who you are is a product of what you do. As we shall see, though, theatrical performatives risk being “infelicitous,” in the words of philosopher J.L. Austin: instead of affirming the subjects they represent, the performances can turn those subjects into mere theater. Our starting assumption is that many Broadway stake-holders genuinely desire broader representation in and for their work, but that the structure of the industry constrains how these shows challenge the status quo. To understand those constraints we will ask what stories Broadway tells, who sees them, and how they are marketed—while always attuned to “who tells your story.”</p>","year":2019.5},{"id":"60231","title":"Modern Drama","termName":"Spring","termYear":2008,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":121737,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>A survey course which examines landmark works from Ibsen to Kushner through a focus on generative cultural and stylistic moments (The Woman Question 1880-1900; The Theater of the Absurd 1950-60; The AIDS Crisis 1985-95, etc.).

From the nautical sense we also understand any volume, which fills or occupies a liquid space that changes to accommodate it, a useful metaphor for intellectual displacements—as we bend, shift and make room for new ideas in our minds. In psychology, a displacement is the transference of a site of trauma from one person, scenario, or object to another. Finally, there are histories of human displacement, a broad category under which to consider narratives generated by migration, emigration, exile, and enslavement. In this seminar we will read from texts that contribute in all of these ways, often interrelated, to a “literature of displacement.” We will read novels, essays, and memoirs by Joseph Conrad, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, James Baldwin, Tayeb Salih, Valeria Luiselli, and W.G. Sebald and watch films by Les Blank, Charles Burnett, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Edward Yang among others. We will ask how these works respond to the trials and rewards of belonging to, or being alienated from, cultures and communities; how history and loss imprint us with identity but also disrupt it; what we learn from encountering other places and perspectives. Can remembering, witnessing, and storytelling create a place for ourselves in a world founded on an ongoing and massive experience of perpetual displacement?</p>","year":2019.5},{"id":"106154","title":"Southern Literature and Culture in the United States","termName":"Spring","termYear":2009,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":145347,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This interdisciplinary course examines the rich tradition of Southern literature and culture in the US from slavery to the present.

In that sense, many books are ‘feminist.’” This course focuses on such feminist books. It explores issues of perspective: what happens when an author writes from the perspective of a woman?

We tend to think of such collaborative work today, in think tanks, Silicon Valley incubators, literary movements and artists' colonies, as a fairly recent phenomenon, but it was in fact powerfully modeled a century ago. \"Bloomsbury\" included novelists Virginia Woolf and E.M. Forster, both of whom are also literary critics; biographer and essayist Lytton Strachey; economist John Maynard Keynes; socialist and publisher Leonard Woolf; philosophers G.E.Moore and Bertrand Russell; artists Vanessa Bell, Dora Carrington, and Duncan Grant; art critics Clive Bell and Roger Fry; and the English translators of Sigmund Freud, James and Alix Strachey--- each of whom had an enormous effect on the form of the genre, or genres, in which they worked. Not to mention other friends, lovers and rivals: Vita Sackville-West, David Garnett, Aldous Huxley, Katherine Mansfield, just to name a few. This course will look at the interdisciplinary effect of brilliant and talented people from across the spectrum of the arts and social sciences influencing each other’s work and participating in its creation and publication. Readings to include the major novels and essays of Virginia Woolf, the biographies and essays of Lytton Strachey, and substantial selections from other theorists, artists, critics and practitioners, together with relevant films, letters, and elements of design and home décor. In addition to our scrutiny of these works, in printed texts and in rare book libraries and museums, the members of the seminar will work to design and develop an undergraduate General Education course on the Bloomsbury Group.</p>","year":2017},{"id":"233542","title":"Joyce/Beckett: Graduate Seminar","termName":"Fall","termYear":2013,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":130298,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>The seminar offers an in-depth study of <em>Ulysses</em> and of Beckett's dramatic oeuvre.

Reconstruction (1865 - 1877) ushered in a “Second Founding” of the nation through the ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution, abolishing slavery, establishing birthright citizenship, due process and equal protection of the laws, and the right to vote for black male citizens. As revolutionary as Reconstruction was, it was also short-lived, and the long, violent roll-back against it, curiously known as the “Redemption,” witnessed the curtailing of these rights and the rise and institutionalization of Jim Crow segregation in what one newspaper editor coined the “New South.”&nbsp; A key aspect of Redemption was a propaganda war designed to debase the image of African Americans, and thereby justify the deprivation of their rights. Resisting it, African Americans, starting in the mid-1890s, employed the concept of a “New Negro” to combat racist images of an “Old Negro” fabricated by apologists for Jim Crow. Thus began what we might call America’s first “social media” race war.&nbsp; The trope of a New Negro underwent several revisions between the 1890’s and 1920’s, when—in the midst of the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North—the Harvard-trained philosopher, Alain Locke, revised and appropriated the term&nbsp; to describe a remarkable flowering of art and literature that he named “The New Negro Renaissance.”&nbsp; Later commentators would label the period “The Harlem Renaissance.”&nbsp; Locke and his contemporaries thought that “armed with culture,” as W.E.B. Du Bois wrote much later, they could efficaciously wage the struggle against anti-black racism through what an historian of the period cleverly called “civil rights by copyright.”&nbsp;&nbsp; This course traces the history of the metaphor of a “New Negro” from its inception at the dawn of Jim Crow to the end of The New Negro Renaissance in the Great Depression.</p>","year":2019},{"id":"44360","title":"The African-American Literary Tradition","termName":"Spring","termYear":1993,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":142679,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Explores the emergence and formal development of the Afro-American literary \"tradition,\" from the 18th to the 20th century.

From the nautical sense we also understand any volume, which fills or occupies a liquid space that changes to accommodate it, a useful metaphor for intellectual displacements—as we bend, shift and make room for new ideas in our minds. In psychology, a displacement is the transference of a site of trauma from one person, scenario, or object to another. Finally, there are histories of human displacement, a broad category under which to consider narratives generated by migration, emigration, exile, and enslavement. In this seminar we will read from texts that contribute in all of these ways, often interrelated, to a “literature of displacement.” We will read novels, essays, and memoirs by Joseph Conrad, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, James Baldwin, Tayeb Salih, Valeria Luiselli, and W.G. Sebald and watch films by Les Blank, Charles Burnett, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Edward Yang among others. We will ask how these works respond to the trials and rewards of belonging to, or being alienated from, cultures and communities; how history and loss imprint us with identity but also disrupt it; what we learn from encountering other places and perspectives. Can remembering, witnessing, and storytelling create a place for our selves in a world founded on an ongoing and massive experience of perpetual displacement?&nbsp;</p>","year":2018.5},{"id":"119301","title":"Diffusions: The Global Bildungsrom","termName":"Fall","termYear":2011,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":146177,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Established by Goethe at the end of the eighteenth century, the bildungsroman (or novel of education) has since travelled around the world; this course will explore its appearance in Britain, the United States, and Nigeria, focusing on the new forms that the genre takes as it enters these new cultures and interacts with their existing literary traditions.

We will study the novel as a genre and literary realism as a strategy of representation and how these emerge from social and political history. We will also read brief accounts of the economic culture of each historical moment. Authors may include: F.

Given the chronological distance between their careers, Chekhov and Beckett show the felt experience of time in remarkably similar ways, and drew upon many of the same philosophical influences, from Leopardi to Schopenhauer to Nietzsche. They both were attuned to the ways in which a reader and audience member experience time differently, the prisoner and free person, women and men. In their work, they grappled with slowness and quickness, boredom and excitement. They thought about the end of time, and how an awareness of time—its finitude, or the feeling of proximity to death it can cause—can break the reader or viewer through to personal, artistic, and political revolutions. Through our readings, we will survey how each figure understands time, and the relevance of that portrayal within its particular historical and artistic context. For Chekhov, we will show the depiction of time as Chekhov’s confronting the influence of Russian Realist and Naturalist literature, borrowing from the influence of his long travels and research in Siberia, his readings in French novels and drama, medical education and practice, experience with tuberculosis, experimentation at the Moscow Art Theater, and his prognostications and influence anteceding Russian Avant Gardism and the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917. For Beckett, we will study his literary dilation and distortion of time as a response to Marcel Proust, James Joyce, the Second World War and his work in the French Resistance, Aburdism and Existentialism, Postmodernism, and film and television.&nbsp;</p>","year":2019.5},{"id":"123682","title":"Calvinist Legacy in American Culture","termName":"Spring","termYear":2008,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":120932,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course will cover American texts from the Puritan settlement through the present, with emphasis on the twentieth century.

This seminar examines a history of Shakespeare in the English-speaking theater to illuminate how Shakespeare helps to shape theater and how the theater helps to make Shakespeare. We will read a number of Shakespeare’s works, but will attend not to literary interpretations of the texts, but rather to (a) the problems those texts create in performance and (b) how artists have solved those challenges over the past four centuries. In other words, we will explore both prior approaches to staging Shakespeare and what in Shakespeare’s plays makes them particularly difficult—and exciting—to stage.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"229293","title":"Southern Folklore and Southern Literature","termName":"Fall","termYear":2000,"subjectDescription":"English","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"English","subject":"ENGLISH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"English and American Literature and Language","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":114518,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Chiefly an introduction to the folk literature of the South_folk tales, ballads, and similar oral and popular genres_and to its cultural contexts.

The course will consist of two halves. The first hour of the class will be devoted to discussion and close analysis of a particular writer’s style in the assigned text that will be circulated a week in advance. The idea is to look at a wide range of writing styles and try to isolate what is unique about each, how the relevant style and meaning correspond, in what ways a writer’s style is a window on the world s/he is representing, how style relates to affect, and other such questions. The class would be particularly suited to those who have taken at least two previous Creative Writing courses. Beginners should apply to the ‘Introduction to fiction’ classes being offered. &nbsp;</p><p>In the second half of the class, divided into two equal segments of an hour each, we will be workshopping the writing of two students. Our goal is for each of you to have two turns, and approximately 5-10,000 words of your work critiqued, by the time semester ends.
