The writings of the Greek founders, starting with Zeno of Citium in the early third century BCE, now exist only in quotations and paraphrases in later authors, but Roman Stoicism is well attested in complete surviving works of Cicero, Seneca and others. A version of Stoic ethics became something of a default guide to life for generations of well-born Romans. In this course we will read the main surviving texts of Stoicism, and examine Stoic ideas under the three headings of physics/metaphysics, ethics and logic. The Stoics developed the first detailed and systematic account of nature that can be thought of as materialist, and the first such account of ethics based on the idea of natural law.

We’ll read both classical texts such as the Analects of Confucius, Mengzi, Xunzi, Mozi, and Zhuangzi and important contemporary scholarship on these texts. Several moral questions will be of particular importance: What is the relationship between etiquette and morality? What are the most important virtues to acquire? Should we think of morality and moral development as something natural or artificial? Are we justified in caring more about some people (our closest friends and family) than others? We will have a special focus on three important interpretive themes for the course: (1) How can understanding the particular contours of the debates each scholar is engaged in help us understand their overall views? (2) How does each philosopher’s view of human psychology and epistemology constrain, guide, and support their moral theorizing? (3) How can an understanding of early Chinese ethical thought, theory, and debate help enrich contemporary discussions in ethics and moral philosophy?

The standard way of explaining the meanings of modal idioms like ‘necessarily’ --in terms of “truth at a possible world” --has been taken over by many linguists as a tool to analyze meaning in natural language (so-called ‘possible worlds semantics’). It has also been used to study the nature of provability in formal systems, to analyze programs in computer science, and to model temporal processes.&nbsp;</p><p>This course is first and foremost a course in logic, but one that attends to modal logic’s uses in philosophy and the study of language. One of the goals of the course is to introduce you to doing metatheory–proving things like completeness and soundness for logical systems. We also look in some detail some applications of modal logic and its semantics, discussing such things as:&nbsp; semantics for counterfactual conditionals; mutual knowledge and conversational context; the use of modal logic to model such things as computer programs and non-standard (e.g., intutitionistic) mathematical systems.</p><p>The course does not suppose that you know any logic.

Yet space and time are ubiquitous in that the events of everyday life and physics are described within the framework of space and time. What exactly is this framework? Is it merely conventional or does it capture a fundamental feature of reality? What is the relationship between space and time? Are they independent of one another? Are they intertwined? Are they fixed? Can they be manipulated? In this course we will try to get clear on such questions by tracing the historical development from the time of Newton to the present, while also employing tools of modern geometry to sharpen the fundamental notions and the central questions. Some of the main spacetimes we shall see along the way are: Newtonian Spacetime (the spacetime associated with everyday common sense), Minkowskian Spacetime (the spacetime of special relativity, where space and time are intertwined), and Einsteinian Spacetime (the spacetime of general relativity, where space and time can be warped and manipulated). We will see that our understanding of spacetime has undergone radical transformations, that there has been a great deal of progress in our understanding, and we shall get&nbsp;into some of the more fascinating issues that arise with our contemporary understanding, issues involving black holes, singularities, time travel, and other spacetime anomalies.&nbsp;</p><p>Prerequisites: An introductory course in linear algebra and calculus.</p>","year":2018.5},{"id":"154834","title":"Philosophy and the Exact Sciences: Proseminar","termName":"Fall","termYear":2011,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Proseminar","externalCourseId":127975,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This is the first in a two-part series of courses dealing with the history of the relationship between philosophy and the exact sciences.

What kind of personality could you cultivate that would give you and those around you the best chances of not only being happy, but of flourishing? In both historical and contemporary ethical thought, an appreciation for the richness, subtlety, and complexity of our moral and intellectual lives has attracted philosophers to approaches we now think of virtue ethical and virtue epistemological, respectively. These approaches broadly seek to answer the question of how we can develop ourselves to be at our moral and intellectual best. In this course, we will start by examining both historical and contemporary approaches to virtue ethics. Then, we will turn to examining recent developments in the burgeoning field of virtue epistemology. Finally, we will examine specific moral, intellectual, civic, social, and executive virtues and vices in more detail. Students will be tasked with identifying and examining in detail the specific virtues they find most important or valuable and the specific vices they find most dangerous in their own lives.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"317505","title":"Truth, Rationality, and Objectivity","termName":"Spring","termYear":1995,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":112473,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>An examination of truth, rationality and objectivity, and of controversies about social construction, realism, and relativism, as these arise in philosophy, the humanities, the history of science, the social and the natural sciences, and politics.</p>","year":1995},{"id":"122851","title":"Rationality and Irrationality","termName":"Fall","termYear":2013,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":120737,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>What kind of power is rationality; in what respects does it set humans apart from nonrational creatures?

We'll think about the role the family plays in sustaining gender inequality, consider several proposals for political interventions intended to make society more gender just, and ask whether those proposals constitute legitimate uses of political power.

We say that someone enjoys a high level of well-being when the life that they lead is a good one for them, and that when someone’s life goes poorly for them, their level of well-being is low. We can all probably point to certain kinds of lives that are paradigmatically high or low in well-being. But it is harder to identify what makes it the case that someone has a particular level of well-being, primarily because it is not obvious what things fundamentally contribute to or detract from the value of one’s life. In this seminar, we will consider contemporary approaches to welfare, including recent defenses of monistic theories like hedonism and the desire-satisfaction theory, as well as pluralistic theories. Though it will not be the primary focus of the course, we will also consider attempts to measure well-being in the social sciences, with special attention paid to what, if anything, value theorists and social scientists have to learn from one another.</p>","year":2018},{"id":"61239","title":"Political Philosophy","termName":"Fall","termYear":1999,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":112245,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>A critical introduction to issues of state authority, justice, liberty and equality through readings of major works in political philosophy, including the writings of such theorists as Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx, and Rawls.</p>","year":1999.5},{"id":"86520","title":"Political Philosophy","termName":"Fall","termYear":2001,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":112245,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>A critical introduction to issues of state authority, justice, liberty and equality through readings of major works in political philosophy, including the writings of such theorists as Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Marx, and Rawls.</p>","year":2001.5},{"id":"128790","title":"Political and Social Philosophy","termName":"Spring","termYear":1990,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":122140,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Course created to support student import</p>","year":1990},{"id":"245448","title":"Political Philosophy","termName":"Fall","termYear":2006,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":112245,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>What sort of political institutions should we have?

However, parents are generally allowed to act on the bodies of their children: they feed them, change their diapers, cut their hair, make them play sports, make major medical decisions, etc. Reproductive technology has now made it possible for parents to shape their children’s bodies by creating children with specific physical traits. In this seminar, we will explore the limits of parental permission to shape the bodies of their future children. We will ask the question: whose body is it anyway? We will consider questions like the following: Is there a moral difference between making a child wear glasses and selecting for a child with good eyesight? Should parents be permitted to select for disability? Do parents have an obligation to enhance their children's physical or mental capacities? We will consider how thinking about the obligations parents have to their existing children bears on what prospective parents owe their future children.</p>","year":2019},{"id":"50062","title":"Political Philosophy","termName":"Spring","termYear":2006,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":119516,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>What is a just society?

The notion of a practical reason has played a central role in ethical theorizing over the past several decades, and continues to enjoy close philosophical attention today. In this course, we'll first endeavor to get a clear sense of the general structure of practical reasons, and to disentangle them from nearby, but distinct, concepts. We'll then take a close look at several contemporary disputes about practical reasons. Primary among them is a question about how practical reasons are grounded: what makes it the case that something is a reason? Investigating this question will bring us into contact with debates about how reasons are related to desires, motivation, value, and moral requirements. We will also consider error-theoretic approaches to practical normativity, according to which there are no genuine practical reasons of the sort that most ethicists have in mind.</p>","year":2017},{"id":"40611","title":"Recent Ethical Theory","termName":"Fall","termYear":2005,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":120611,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Some of the major trends in contemporary ethical theory, concentrating on questions about the nature of and relation between justice, happiness, and practical rationality.

Yet we rarely reflect on what work even isor what role it can or should play in a fulfilling existence. Particularly since technological and economic changes seem to portend a future of radically different possibilities for work, questions related to the meaning of labor are receiving increased attention. Does work have a place in a philosophically and spiritually informed life? How does work relate to its ostensible opposite, leisure? Does work contribute to or distract from the highest human purposes? This course will consider contemporary questions like these in light of the tradition of Western philosophical reflection. The course will consider the foundational perspectives of Plato and Aristotle on work and leisure as well as the contributions of Augustine and Aquinas.

Although we will consider a variety of issues we will concentrate on two principal topics. Firstly, we will consider the significance of groups in relation to the claims and demands of social and political justice. Should social groups be thought to have a fundamental normative significance in political philosophy or must we reduce all political claims and interests to the claims and interests of individuals? What is the significance of social groups to questions of distributive justice? What sort of social groups are relevant to questions of distributive justice and why are they relevant? Are there group membership rights? What is the nature and foundation of these rights, and do these rights conflict with liberal political thought? The second dimension of the course concerns the significance of groups as subjects to the demands of justice. Is it only the political community, taken as a group, that is answerable to fundamental principles of social justice, or do these principles also govern the individual conduct of a political community’s members? Do national groups bear responsibility as a group for what the group does? Can social groups in a society be deemed collectively responsible for certain social and political outcomes? What is the nature and mechanism of this group responsibility?

He provided a powerful and systematic defence of an egalitarian liberal framework that reinvigorated Anglo-American political philosophy. Moreover, his philosophical methodology became enormously influential in normative theory, and the questions which preoccupied him set the research agenda for much of the subsequent work in political philosophy. In this course, we will examine contemporary liberal political theory with special attention to Rawls’s work. Before engaging his seminal text, we will examine the utilitarian tradition to which Rawls’s ‘Theory of Justice’ was, in part, a critical reaction. We will then consider the later development of Rawls’s thought in his book ‘Political Liberalism’; a work which updated the argument for the principles he outlined in ‘A Theory of Justice’ in a way that sought to accommodate the deep and intractable disagreements that citizens in a liberal society have regarding their philosophical, religious, and ethical views. Throughout the course, we will consider a number of direct and indirect critical responses to Rawls’s views. Firstly, works that contended with the substantive direction in which Rawls took liberal theory, as well as the justificatory foundation he provided for that theory. Secondly, works that disputed the methodological choices and conceptual framing devices which Rawls’s used to approach the subject of political philosophy more broadly.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"122318","title":"Human Being and the Sacred in the History of the West","termName":"Spring","termYear":2009,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":124570,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>What stand should we take on our lives, our activity, and who we are to be?

Should a person focus on achieving immortality or on living a simple, happy mortal life? Is morality simply a matter of convention? Why be moral when being immoral could provide access to more wealth, fame, and power? What is the relationship between etiquette and morality? What do people owe a society that has failed in its obligations to its people? How can we identify and resist oppression, marginalization, and injustice? Human beings all over the world have been thinking about, discussing, and debating questions like these for thousands of years. This course aims to look at this history of ethics and moral philosophy from a genuinely inclusive perspective by focusing on ethical thought both from members of traditionally marginalized groups and from areas of the world that typically receive much less attention in academic philosophy and ethics. We will examine ethical thought from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Greece, as well as later ethical thought from throughout Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. We will emphasize the development of two important critical reading skills: (1) the ability to infer more general ethical frameworks and theories from more narrowly-focused discussions in particular texts, and (2) the ability to infer ways in which the ideas, claims, and arguments in historical ethical texts are morally relevant for one’s own life.</p>","year":2019.5},{"id":"76658","title":"Contemporary Theories of Justice: Proseminar","termName":"Spring","termYear":2000,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Proseminar","externalCourseId":110657,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course focuses on recent debates in political philosophy about social and political justice.

Our main goals in this seminar will be: (1) understand Aristotle’s often difficult arguments and how they hang together; (2) see what we can learn about the earlier atomistic theories that Aristotle is rejecting, and the motivations for those earlier theories (Democritus, Leucippus, Plato…); (3) consider how atomists after Aristotle understood and responded to his arguments (Epicurus and his followers). We will also try to understand what is at stake in the debate over atomism — from simple questions like what it is for two things to touch, to larger questions like whether anything ever comes into being or perishes, and, if so, how. Since part of the debate seems to center around different responses to Eleatic arguments concerning the oneness of being and the impossibility of motion (Parmenides, Zeno), we will look at those arguments as well.</p><p>Primary texts will be made available both in Greek and in English translation. Required secondary readings will be in English, together with a few suggested readings in German for those who can read them.

It is clear, however, that no account of intentional human action that restricts itself to reasoning will be adequate. Much of what we do seems to be the outcome of some kind of inner struggle or conflict about what to do, or (in the more momentous cases) which path in life to follow, and sometimes we act in ways we know to be ‘contrary to reason’. It is not at all clear what’s really going on when this happens.</p><p>Plato (428-348 BCE), Augustine (354-430 CE) and Freud (1856-1939) offer especially interesting and plausible accounts of such inner conflict. In their different ways, they each understood such conflict in terms of the soul’s having parts, or distinct faculties. They are also alike in positing a fundamental but highly plastic force in the soul, in terms of which its development or deformation, including its division into parts, can be understood. They all called this force love, although it is not straightforward what they meant, or whether they meant the same thing, by calling it that.</p><p>In this course, we will look at these theories of the composite, love-driven psyche as expressed in various of their works, such as Plato’s Gorgias, Symposium and Republic, Augustine’s Confessions and De Trinitate, and Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams and The Ego and the Id.

Consider the animating problem: We seem to have wide moral prerogative to take special care of those we love, including especially members of our families. But the institution of the family seriously hinders attempts to make society more just, as evidenced by the many ways families transfer advantage across generations. What are we to make of this tension between social justice and the family, and what—if anything—can we do to resolve it? These questions are deeply important for our own lives, and will be deeply important for the lives of the students we go on to explore them with. I hope our group will include participants from different social and disciplinary backgrounds, and correspondingly that the courses we design will incorporate readings and methodologies that reflect our diversity. Most of the readings for our seminar will be scholarship on the central substantive questions outlined above, and each participant will have the opportunity to propose readings for us to consider together. We will engage with the material both as scholarship and as possible content for our subsequent courses, and participants will write regular discussion memos on the readings. Each participant will also read a book on pedagogy or learning theory, and write a precis of the book for the class. The sustained pedagogical project of the course will be to build an understanding of student-centered course design by practicing it in the context of the course we’ll be designing together.</p>","year":2018},{"id":"92600","title":"Nonconsequentialist Ethical Theory: Seminar","termName":"Spring","termYear":2008,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":122281,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Topics include: principles of permissible harm to persons; the role of intention, the theory of rights, nonconsequentialist approaches to distribution of goods and harms, and applications to issues in the morality of war and terrorism.</p>","year":2008},{"id":"124631","title":"Nonconsequentialist Ethical Theory","termName":"Spring","termYear":2005,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":118756,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Nonconsequentialist ethical theory and aspects of consequentialism including: principles of permissible harm to persons; theory of rights and its relation to contractualism; responsibility for harms done in collaboration with others; the relevance of distance.</p>","year":2005},{"id":"139734","title":"Nonconsequentialist Ethical Theory","termName":"Spring","termYear":2006,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":118756,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Nonconsequentialist ethical theory and aspects of consequentialism including: principles of permissible harm to persons; theory of rights and its relation to contractualism; responsibility for harms done in collaboration with others; the relevance of distance.</p>","year":2006},{"id":"200840","title":"Nonconsequentialist Ethical Theory: Seminar","termName":"Spring","termYear":2007,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":122281,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Topics include: principles of permissible harm to persons; the role of intention, the theory of rights, nonconsequentialist approaches to distribution of goods and harms, and applications to issues in the morality of war and terrorism.</p>","year":2007},{"id":"262429","title":"Nonconsequentialist Ethical Theory","termName":"Spring","termYear":2004,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":118756,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Nonconsequentialist ethical theory and aspects of consequentialism including: principles of permissible harm to persons; theory of rights and its relation to contractualism; responsibility for harms done in collaboration with others; the relevance of distance.</p>","year":2004},{"id":"323721","title":"Nonconsequentialist Ethical Theory: Seminar","termName":"Spring","termYear":2012,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":122281,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Harming and benefiting people.

The basic outlook of value and perspective that each of us adopts as we make decisions large and small are more than mere opinion. They are commitments that are open to deeper understanding and critique. Philosophy is pursuing such understanding and critique, and this course will introduce you to it. The course has a two-fold focus: we will look at some of the central figures and problems of the Western philosophical tradition, including Socrates, Plato, Descartes, Locke, Kant, and Mill. We'll also look at how contemporary writers have responded to this tradition, especially from a feminist and anti-racist perspective. These include Charles Mills, Helen Longino, bell hooks, and Paul Taylor. This course has no prerequisites. Students need not have taken or be enrolled in Expos before taking this course: the course will introduce you to the mechanics and practice of philosophical writing.</p>","year":2019.5},{"id":"282397","title":"Introduction to the Problems of Philosophy","termName":"Fall","termYear":1997,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":111175,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Introduction to the methods of contemporary philosophy by examining three issues: l.

this course we will examine a range of issues which we might, very loosely, term questions of social, cultural, and artistic representation. For instance, the construction, deployment, and celebration of historical narratives are a familiar part of the political pageantry in the life of nations. What are the ethical constraints and imperatives relating to the representation of these national histories? How do these injunctions relate to present political norms of equality and inclusivity and the demands of social cohesion? Consider, also, representational questions that arise in relation to norms of social interaction. What, for instance, might be considered wrong with cultural appropriation? When is it wrong to allow social stereotypes to inform one’s interpersonal interactions, and should this wrong be understood in primarily moral or epistemological terms? Finally, consider ethical issues relating to our engagement with (construed broadly) artistic representations. How can we ethically enjoy tragedy? On the face of things it would appear paradoxical or else the mark of a sadist. Are pornographic representations of immoral acts wrong to consume and enjoy? Are there any special ethical constraints on what may be represented in a video game? Can we ethically represent the Holocaust in any artistic medium? Can we continue to enjoy the products of artists who have engaged in immoral actions?&nbsp; Although we should not expect a set of master principles to govern this range of topics, we might realistically hope that the answers we give, and the philosophical difficulties we encounter in any one topic will help illuminate our treatment and investigation of the others.</p>","year":2019},{"id":"190575","title":"Indian Philosophy","termName":"Spring","termYear":2015,"subjectDescription":"Philosophy","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","subject":"PHIL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Philosophy","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":156132,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>A survey of Indian philosophy through an engagement with classical debates in epistemology-sense perception, inferential reasoning, and testimony; metaphysics; philosophy of action; philosophy of language; and philosophy of mind.
