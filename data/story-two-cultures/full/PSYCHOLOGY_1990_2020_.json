Choices can be big and consequential (should I focus on my success, family, or passion), or small and everyday (going out, or staying in). This course will introduce you to the cognitive science of judging and choosing. You will learn about 1) Rational planning, the kind a perfect intelligence might carry out 2) Common simplifications and shortcuts that non-perfect humans use, and how these may actually be appealing approximations for any decision-making system 3) Regret over choices taken and not taken 4) Making decisions with others 5) Transformative decisions, the ones that change who you are as a person. As we cover these topics, we will consider how to apply the insights from the psychology of decision making to your own ordinary and extraordinary choices.&nbsp;</p>","year":2020},{"id":"233935","title":"Group Psychology and Team Development","termName":"Fall","termYear":1991,"subjectDescription":"Psychology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Psychology","subject":"PSY","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Psychology","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":117253,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Observational research and direct experience in interpersonal behavior, group dynamics, and team development.

But a leader's impact only goes so far unless s/he takes steps to engineer optimal decision environments for the organization as a whole. By gaining an understanding of fundamental mind-brain-behavior relationships in judgment and decision making, you will become better able to design decision environments that make everyone smarter - i.e., less susceptible to common errors and biases. Taking this course will not tell you what to choose but it will give you frameworks that reveal how to choose and how to structure optimal decision environments. Specifically, course topics will include (a) cognitive processes in perception, memory and context-dependence; (b) how questions affect answers; (c) models of decision making; (d) heuristics and biases; (e) social and group influences; (f) common traps; and (g) de-biasing techniques. We will also discuss emotional influences on decision making. The lectures and discussions will be coordinated to complement weekly readings, which draw from psychology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience.  Throughout the course, the overarching goals are to: (1) Learn about the academic field of behavioral decision making, its major theories, results, and debates. (2) Become a critical consumer of research findings, learning methodological standards for evaluating the soundness of empirical studies. (3) Develop the ability to effectively write and speak about behavioral science theories, results, and debates. (4) Acquire practical skills for improving your own judgments and decisions. (5) Acquire knowledge of which biases leaders can address with training/knowledge versus which biases respond best to institutional design changes (e.g., nudges). (6) Learn when and how to conduct a randomized controlled field experiment. (7) Develop a capstone project in which you apply the material to improve professional decision making processes.

What are the biological, cultural, and individual factors that influence this development? We will look the development of social behavior from infancy into adolescence, focusing on the types of behaviors that are most relevant at each age.

Meditation in particular has gained tremendous traction and empirical evidence supporting its many benefits – psychological and otherwise, leading even the more skeptical to acknowledge its value.

This class covers basic and advanced topics of Bayesian statistics in a very applied way with a strong focus on applications in &nbsp;Psychology (and Social Sciences in general). Formulas and technical details are kept on a minimum -- it is all about how to integrate Bayesian concepts into your everyday research.  The first part of the course introduces students to the Bayesian paradigm of inferential statistics (as opposed to the frequentist approach everyone is familiar with). We elaborate on Bayes' seminal theorem and introduce gently the core components of Bayesian inference: &nbsp;prior distributions, posterior distributions, and Bayes factors. Subsequently, we will learn about simulation based approaches for sampling posterior distributions. These are the infamous MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) techniques and have fancy names such as Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling.  Then we are ready to actually do Bayesian inference and testing. We start with simple statistical tests and models such as t-test, ANOVA, and regression and compute them&nbsp; in a Bayesian way. We extend our modeling approach to generalized linear models (GLM) and a model family where Bayesian statistics turns out to be super helpful: hierarchical (aka multilevel or mixed-effects) models.  &nbsp;Finally, we focus on modern, more specific (psychometric) Bayesian methods such as multidimensional/multilevel item response theory (IRT), Bayesian latent variable&nbsp; models, latent Dirichlet allocations (LDA; as e.g. used in natural language processing), and Bayesian networks.  All topics covered will be supported by corresponding computations and illustrations in R. Lab units focus on knitting!

We extend the linear mixed-effects model in terms of non-linear effects which leads to generalized additive mixed-effects models (GAMM), with spline specifications at its core. At this point we will also introduce cross-validation as a tool for assessing predictive accuracy of a model while avoiding overfitting. This is followed by shrinkage/regularization techniques (Lasso) which are attractive for regression scenarios with many predictors. In the time series unit we introduce strategies for finding patterns in time trajectories and making corresponding predictions (ARIMA models, Holt-Winters smoothing).</p><p>In Unit 5 we model trajectories using concepts from functional data analysis (FDA) where each single individual is represented by a function (e.g. growth curve, EEG signal, etc.). Graphical models (Unit 6) allow us to model dependencies in complex multivariate datasets (e.g., studying relationships among clinical symptoms). In the subsequent units we move into Machine Learning territory. We start with unsupervised learning which is essentially clustering. Basic approaches such as hierarchical clustering techniques and k-means are explained. We proceed with borderline unsupervised/supervised approaches such as association rules and Kohonen networks. In Unit 9 we learn more advanced parametric clustering techniques (mixture distributions) which we will then integrate into a regression framework (mixture regression). Hidden Markov models will be introduced within this context as well.</p><p>The remaining three units are all about supervised learning where our aim is classification/prediction. Unit 10 presents tree-based approaches (decision/regression trees), model-based recursive partitioning (i.e., finding optimal predictor splits in e.g. a mixed-effects regression model), and ensemble tree learning (random forests).</p><p>In Unit 11 we briefly introduce discriminant analysis and extend it to support vector machines (SVM), often applied on fMRI data. Finally, we will cover neural networks and some modern “deep learning” flavors.</p>","year":2017.5},{"id":"72068","title":"Issues in Development","termName":"Fall","termYear":1993,"subjectDescription":"Psychology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Psychology","subject":"PSY","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Psychology","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":118629,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>An overview of selected issues in development, concentrating on research data and theory in cognitive, affective, and social development during the first ten years.

We examine such problems as the mental imagery debate, how an infant's looks tell us about its thoughts, the extent to which evolutionary theories of human thought can be tested, how neuroimaging data inform our understanding of mental representation, what inferences can be made from the study of the performance of damaged systems, the role of computational modeling in theory evaluation and development, and so on.

The primary objective of the course is to provide students with the concepts and tools needed for planning and designing laboratory experiments, and for collecting and analyzing behavioral data. The course will also discuss other methodologies that may be helpful when working with field sites (namely, field experiments and surveys). A secondary objective is to provide students the foundations for the methodological evaluation of other behavioral researchers' work - a skill that will be helpful in their role as future academic reviewers. The course thus covers the designs and analyses that are most often used by experimental researchers in psychology, organizational behavior, and also marketing. The course will be hands-on and oriented towards providing technical skills for the design and implementation of laboratory experiments, including overcoming possible pitfalls and common barriers. The course assignment will be for students to write a proposal outlining the theory, design, power analyses, and proposed analysis for a laboratory experiment. Our hope is that the students will conduct the research during the course or afterwards, and that this course will help design and conduct impactful and rigorous behavioral research. Overall goal The overall goal of the course is for students to understand that how they design their experiment (all aspects of it) has a large role in whether they can answer their research questions. Please note that the course will begin on Monday, September 8th. Open to doctoral students only.

Research shows humans fare poorly on such tasks. But the reasons why may surprise you. The way we think, work and communicate is being transformed by technology. This transformation has been beneficial. For example, personal and professional productivity was often capped due to limits in human attention, memory and decision making. Society could – owing to these ‘frailties’ – only do, so much. Technology now helps us do more. But its use also raises questions. For example, do we trust technology to much? Is it possible to rely on technology for work and still be good at work? And perhaps most importantly, should society be motivated to work if machines can perform that work more efficiently and safely?
