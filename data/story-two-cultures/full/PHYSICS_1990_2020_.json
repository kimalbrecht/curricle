Primarily, we will be interested in condensed matter systems - eg. electrons in solids or ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices - although the concepts invoked will be more generally applicable. Mostly, we will study well defined microscopic models, involving a finite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume, such as spins on a lattice. Our aim will be to understand the physics at much longer scales, where rich phenomena described by universal laws emerge. Simple spin models will be shown, at long distances, to give rise to remarkable new excitations, from `sound’ and `light’, to fermions and even more exotic excitations. Often, (but not always) we will use quantum field theory to describe this physics, which may also help demystify the origin of quantum field theory in a physical setting free from 'infinities.'</p><p>Two criteria are applied when selecting topics. First, that they be of experimental relevance and, second, that they illustrate a central concept of quantum many body physics such as (i) the importance of locality in many body systems (ii) symmetry and its spontaneous breaking (iii) origin of gauge theories (iv) finding the right variables to describe the physics (a.k.a. dualities) (v) topological order (vi) scale invariance.</p><p>Planned Topics: 1.The 1+1D transverse field Ising model - duality, fermionization, chiral symmetry. Experimental realization in CoNb2O6. 2. Continuous symmetry breaking in 2+1D. Goldstone modes and the Anderson Tower. Non-perturbative approaches such as dualities and large N expansions. The Mott-superfluid transition in optical lattices.&nbsp; 3. Emergent Gauge Theories and topological order. Confinement and topological order. Chern Simons theories. Fractional quantum Hall states and gapped quantum spin liquids. Emergent electromagnetism in quantum magnets and “Spin-ice”. 4. Special Topics: Quantum entanglement in many body systems.

Primarily, we will be interested in condensed matter systems - eg. electrons in solids or ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices - although the concepts invoked will be more generally applicable. Mostly, we will study well defined microscopic models, involving a finite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume, such as spins on a lattice. Our aim will be to understand the physics at much longer scales, where rich phenomena described by universal laws emerge. Simple spin models will be shown, at long distances, to give rise to remarkable new excitations, from `sound’ and `light’, to fermions and even more exotic excitations. Often, (but not always) we will use quantum field theory to describe this physics, which may also help demystify the origin of quantum field theory in a physical setting free from 'infinities.'</p><p>Two criteria are applied when selecting topics. First, that they be of experimental relevance and, second, that they illustrate a central concept of quantum many body physics such as (i) the importance of locality in many body systems (ii) symmetry and its spontaneous breaking (iii) origin of gauge theories (iv) finding the right variables to describe the physics (a.k.a. dualities) (v) topological order (vi) scale invariance.</p><p>Planned Topics: 1.The 1+1D transverse field Ising model - duality, fermionization, chiral symmetry. Experimental realization in CoNb2O6. 2. Continuous symmetry breaking in 2+1D. Goldstone modes and the Anderson Tower. Non-perturbative approaches such as dualities and large N expansions. The Mott-superfluid transition in optical lattices.&nbsp; 3. Emergent Gauge Theories and topological order. Confinement and topological order. Chern Simons theories. Fractional quantum Hall states and gapped quantum spin liquids. Emergent electromagnetism in quantum magnets and “Spin-ice”. 4. Special Topics: Quantum entanglement in many body systems.

In this course I aim to give a first systematic introduction to some ideas along these lines that have emerged over the past decade. I will present a new formulation of some very basic physics-- fundamental to particle scattering amplitudes and to cosmology--not following from quantum evolution in space-time, but instead associated in a surprising way to new mathematical structures, ranging from the combinatorics and geometry of total positivity and cluster algebras, to period integrals and mixed motives. In these examples, we can concretely see how the usual rules of space-time and quantum mechanics can arise, joined at the hip, from fundamentally geometric and combinatorial origins. The course will be self-contained and should be accessible to physicists and mathematicians alike, &nbsp;with all the relevant physical and mathematical ideas introduced and developed from the ground up.</p>","year":2019.5},{"id":"64869","title":"The Standard Model","termName":"Fall","termYear":2001,"subjectDescription":"Physics","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Physics","subject":"PHYSICS","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Physics","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":113271,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Theory and phenomenology of the Standard Model of particle physics and its extensions.
