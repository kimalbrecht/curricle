The seminar covers a number of themes in migration policies such as the categorization and definition of a “forced” migrant; judicial review of immigration policy; detention; encampment; urban integration; and the rights of migrants (including education, cultural rights and employment) in a comparative context.

This course challenges students to critically evaluate the concept of meritocracy, its origins and contemporary adoption as an ideal worth striving for. Taking a sociological perspective, we ask what a true meritocracy would look like, what its societal implications would be, and what social processes may stand in its way. We then review the empirical record describing people’s various perceptions and explanations of social inequality, and we explore the factors underlying their beliefs. Specifically, what are the psychological underpinnings of people's beliefs about inequality and what role does culture play? Are people’s beliefs most impacted by news reporting, by facts or by experience? We conclude by exploring how beliefs about inequality are mobilized in class and racial conflict, and explore in what ways people’s beliefs are or aren’t likely to change.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"35198","title":"Social Class in the Black Community","termName":"Spring","termYear":2019,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":205208,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course focuses on the rise of class divisions among Black Americans.

Given the changing dynamics between faith and politics, it is doubly important for us to understand the multiple ways religion and politics interact. This course will examine the intersections between religion and politics by exploring questions like&nbsp;why do some religious groups engage in political activism, while others shy away from it? why do some countries try to regulate religious expression in their public spaces, when others celebrate it? why do certain religious groups resort to violence to achieve their aims, and how do some religious groups strive for social justice and peace?The course will begin with a broad overview of the sociology of religion by linking classic sociologists like W. E. Du Bois, Emile Durkheim, and Max Weber to contemporary issues of faith and politics.

The first part of the course focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of economic sociology, and what characterizes a sociological view of the economy. In the second part of the course, we explore some of the social and cultural forces that have shaped key economic institutions such as corporations, insurance, wages and benefits, and marketplaces.

It does so through a sociological exploration of recent transformations in global capitalism, seeking to reveal the worlds of human social practice hidden behind economic categories such as debt, prices, and money, among others. We live in an era of unprecedented social transformation, where the expansion of markets and monetary relations has interwoven the most diverse ecosystems, human groups, cities and settlements into a complex whole. The course begins by analyzing the genesis or ‘pre-history’ of globalization in the forms of market-making and economic interdependence that emerged in the context of empire and modern colonial rule. We then shift towards recent decades in order to interrogate the ways in which global restructurings of capitalist production have transformed world agriculture, finance, urbanization, ecology, governance, and warfare. Because uneven geographical development is a collateral effect of globalization, the course also explores the varieties of sociopolitical contestation concomitant to it. Anti-eviction movements in Spain, far-right political parties across Europe, global peasant movements, fossil fuel divestment movements, and the politics of occupation, will be some of the cases to be examined.  A key aim of the course is to provide students with critical analytical skills to decipher the multiple connections between the political and the economic, ranging from the geopolitical relations of the nation state to the gender relations of the nuclear family. The course introduces students to vibrant sociological theorizations of economic life that have systematically challenged the boundaries between local and global, society and nature, urban and rural. The course is also aimed at furthering the intellectual skills of students by interweaving critical reflection on complex theoretical texts with the analysis of contemporary social, political and economic events.</p>","year":2016.5},{"id":"90018","title":"Globalization, Sex, and Gender","termName":"Spring","termYear":2005,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":119790,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Globalization occurs simultaneously at economic, political and cultural levels, and impacts on virtually all levels of social life.

However, all great scientific advances have been met with resistance from some segment of the public, whether due to threats to established financial interests or through cultural shocks which challenge the existing social order. What are the common features of these panic-promoting innovations? Do they create new social cleavages or exacerbate existing ones? Can we reach a consensus about whether research is unethical or simply unprecedented? How do social contestations around knowledge eventually become resolved? This course reviews some of the most (in)famous historical backlashes against scientific advances - from consequential breakthroughs in disease control to the stuff of science fiction. Along the way we’ll cover crucial case studies relating to sexuality, race, and the environment.

From ceremonial exchanges of goods in the South Pacific, to the development of modern capitalism, and from interlocking relationships between large corporations to wages, remittances, and social networks, economic sociology considers the social contexts that influence how individuals, communities, and societies organize their resources and how these processes in turn impact our lives. This course offers an overview of economic sociology’s major theories and findings across several major themes. The first part of the course focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of economic sociology, and what characterizes a sociological view of the economy. In the second part of the course, we explore some of the social and cultural forces that have shaped key economic institutions such as corporations, insurance, wages and benefits, and marketplaces. The third part of the course considers the impact that these economic institutions have on the quality of life for individuals, communities, and societies. We conclude by asking how the field of economic sociology approaches issues of inequality and social mobility in the United States and globally.</p>","year":2019},{"id":"43467","title":"American Race Relations: Seminar","termName":"Spring","termYear":1993,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":112696,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Examines sociological theories and empirical research on race relations in the U.S. How are race and ethnicity different concepts?

These theoretical issues will be explored through an examination of actual migration flows over time and around the world.&nbsp; Although the focus of the course will be on U.S. immigration, we will also spend some time on non-U.S. flows, including the current refugee crisis in Europe.</p>","year":2018.5},{"id":"31594","title":"Methods for Quantitative Data Analysis","termName":"Spring","termYear":2016,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":159676,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course reviews several of the core methods for analyzing data: data visualization and statistical graphics, simple programming with data, studying data dispersion, statistical inference under model uncertainty and related topics.

In this week-long intensive course, students will learn about the history of behavioral, statistical, and social science genetics, will engage with and discuss the ethics involved in such work, and will become familiar with understanding and applying the cutting-edge research methods in social science genetics on real genetic data. The course will depart from other workshops and courses on this topic in its adherence to understanding the ethics, misinterpretations, and potential social implications of social science genetics. Rather than simply learning and applying a method, we will consider how statistical parameters from genetics research can so easily be misinterpreted or misunderstood.  At the completion of this course, students should expect (1) to have a basic understanding of the fundamental advantages and disadvantages of integrating genetics into social science research; (2) to begin to be able to think about how to incorporate genetic tools like polygenic scores into their own social scientific research within an ethically-straightforward framework; (3) to understand and be able to correctly interpret the basic technical terms from quantitative genetics literature; and (4) to be able to read, interpret, and critique social science genetics studies.  At the beginning of each course day, we will discuss literature relevant to social science genetics methods and research, and then in the afternoon we will transition to hands-on tutorials where students will learn how to clean and analyze genetic data and apply methods from statistic genetics, including genome-wide association studies, heritability and genetic correlation estimation, polygenic score construction and use, etc. We will consider ethics throughout the course and work to build a more ethical framework for social science genetics together. In doing so, we will hear from important scholars working in bioethics and the history of science, and from scholars who have been heavily involved in the communication of social science genetics topics.  Students interested in taking this course should have completed a one-year sequence in statistics and should have some introductory familiarity with statistical software like Stata or R. While we will spend some time at the beginning of the course with introductions to the Linux computing environment, R, and the command line, materials and tutorials will be circulated well before the course. Students should complete these in order to gain familiarity with the computational environment and software we will be working with.  Although the course is intended for sociologists, students from other departments may contact the instructor at rwedow@broadinstitute.org to discuss taking the course.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"1064484","title":"Transnational Historical Sociology: Antisemitism and Imperialism","termName":"Fall","termYear":2019,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":206969,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Sociologists have analyzed empires through the entire history of the discipline.

Hannah Arendt's thesis linking the rise of totalitarianism to imperial practices of government and exploitation, and the use of anti-Semitism to consolidate nationalism is a useful point of departure for investigation of contemporary impact of historical regimes.

Along with engaging several classic and contemporary texts, seminar members will collect, analyze, and wrestle with ethnographic data. In service to the seminar's broad goals, members will engage in various stages of the ethnographic process: gaining access to a research site or population, taking field notes, conducting and transcribing interviews, and engaging in preliminary analyses of their data. We will also discuss the challenges of entering, being in, and leaving the field. The seminar is therefore designed for students who are willing to engage in focused, hands-on training on ethnographic theory and practice. To best take advantage of what this seminar has to offer, members are urged to come in with a preliminary sketch of a research plan that they would be ready to either directly study in the field or explore through field exercises. This will be a working seminar with members sharing field notes and experiences from the field as well as offering advice and constructive criticism at various stages of the process.

While politics can be found in all domains of social life, the ultimate site of political contestation is the state, which holds the legitimate monopoly on physical and symbolic violence. Hence, much political sociology is concerned with the relationship between the state and society: how the modern state came to exist, how it came to be viewed as legitimate, what factors shaped processes of democratization, how cleavages based on class, race, and gender affect democratic representation, how liberal democracies structure their welfare state policies, how states create and manage markets, and how social movements strive to effect political change by making claims on state actors.

We will begin with some of conceptual foundations that ground contemporary sociological studies of sexuality (Freud, Foucault, Kinsey, Lauman, Plummer, Rubin), as well as some thorny methodological debates. (Is there a history of sexuality? How do we measure sexuality?) We will then examine some of the key fields in the sociology of sexualities, including work on sexual identities and social movements, the relationship between institutional contexts and sexual behavior, and intersections with the sociology of race, gender, risk, health and regulation. In each of these discussions, students will explore the varied methodological approaches to these topics within sociology, as well as some of the disciplinary and cultural challenges to making sexuality a central object of intellectual inquiry.</p>","year":2016},{"id":"175209","title":"The Transition to a Market Economy: Seminar","termName":"Spring","termYear":1995,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":116146,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Brings concepts from economic sociology and institutional economics to bear upon the transition away from a Soviet-style command economy in China and Eastern Europe.

Yet the problems of the city remain fundamentally local: housing, economic growth, and public policy are determined by local leaders and contested by urban residents. This course examines urban politics in globalized cities. Using sociological theories of urbanism and politics, we will examine debates over urban issues including housing, job creation, and sustainability. The tutorial will guide students in the preparation of an empirical research paper on an urban issue of their choosing.&nbsp;Topics may include: housing and gentrification; economic development and inequality; globalization and urban culture; technology and urban governance; and the urban environment and sustainability.&nbsp;The class will include workshops on developing a research question and research design. We will explore qualitative research methods, including interviews and ethnography, as well as new methods for observing urban space such as systematic social observation with Google Street View. Throughout, we will refine our understanding of the urban environment, how it is changing in the face of globalization, and what local policy-makers, activists, and residents are doing to shape the future of their cities.</p>","year":2019},{"id":"49402","title":"Race and Crime","termName":"Spring","termYear":2013,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Junior Tutorial","externalCourseId":126243,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>New research on how and why criminal justice policy in the US has such a powerfully differential negative impact on African American communities.

Students will be introduced to key concepts in cultural sociology, through which they will examine how beliefs, attitudes, norms, symbolic boundaries, and frames shape the criminal justice process—from policing and court processing to incarceration and re-entry. Course readings will focus on how the interplay between cultures of dominant actors (e.g., police, prosecutors, and politicians) and those of subordinate actors (e.g., criminal defendants, juvenile offenders, and families) shapes inequality. We will also consider how culture could be used as a tool for creating positive social change in the management of crime and the pursuit of justice. Students will complete an independent research project on some aspect of criminal justice, employing in-depth interviews and/or ethnographic methods to investigate the cultural worlds of institutional actors. Through in-class workshops, we will formulate research questions and develop practicable research designs. These projects will enable students to deeply explore how a qualitative cultural sociological approach can confirm, complement, or even call into question other perspectives on criminal justice. Students will also be expected to consider the limitations of a qualitative cultural sociological approach. Given the sensitive nature of research on the criminal justice system, students will be guided to focus their projects on accessible institutions and actors, such as policymakers, politicians, open court proceedings, and organizations for the formerly incarcerated.</p>","year":2017},{"id":"35050","title":"Collective Identity","termName":"Spring","termYear":2018,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Tutorial","externalCourseId":205091,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Blue collar and middle class, Blacks and Latinx, Christians and Muslims, Americans and French, Harvardians and Yalies –groups have, by their very definition, some criteria to discern those who belong from those who do not, whether they are as large as whole nations, or as small as a group of friends.

This course examines how culture structures what we desire and how what we consume affects our identity and more broadly the systems of inequality in our society. Course readings will focus on the interplay between the sociology of taste and its connections to the market. We will examine key questions such as: Why do we enjoy certain types of music, food, or leisure activities, and what are the implications of these tastes? Who are the key tastemakers who influence us to adopt the tastes we do? How do our consumption patterns relate to our class background and to other social dimensions? How are our tastes related to social movements and political debates? In the first part of the course, students will learn key concepts in the sociology of consumption and culture. In the second part, they will apply this knowledge to a field of consumption that they find most compelling through an independent research project based on qualitative data (interviews and/or ethnographic methods). In-class workshops will assist students in developing a research question, designing a project, collecting and analyzing data, and reporting on findings. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think broadly about the concept of “consumption”, which can apply not only to our preferences for material goods, but also for things such as marriage partners, beauty, careers, and a host of other domains of social life.</p>","year":2018.5},{"id":"58428","title":"Immigration, Politics, and Movements","termName":"Spring","termYear":2011,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Junior Tutorial","externalCourseId":126245,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Examines immigrant integration in the political sphere.

We follow what’s going on and what our friends are doing online. Undoubtedly, media, especially social media, are now crucial to our social, political, and cultural lives. Events around the world—from the Arab Spring to the recent American presidential election—have also shown the importance of media in bringing about social and political change. This course explores the impact of the media—how they have transformed our means of communication, social interaction, news consumption, and political action. Reviewing a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives, we will pursue the following questions, among others: To what extent and in what ways does social media drive political polarization? Is social media making us more or less social? How does social media help to organize collective action? Why can’t people tell fake news from real? What are the consequences of fake news? Methodologically, we will cover how to conduct in-depth interviews, online ethnography, and content analysis.

Networks are involved when people get help (jobs, advice, support), circulate information and gossip, signal status to one another, form opinions and identities, or collaborate in workplaces, social movements, crimes, or other covert activities. Companies and activist groups coordinate and compete with one another in interorganizational networks.&nbsp; International networks depict exchanges of goods and services among countries, as well as alliances and agreements. Networks are important constituents of what has come to be known as “social capital.” Both the “social worlds” surrounding individual people and the “social structure” of groups–both formal and informal–can be informatively conceived of and represented as social networks. Among group-level social phenomena that involve social networks are segregation, status processes, the diffusion of ideas and information, social support, and social influence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tutorial will introduce social network phenomena and research in sociology. We begin by studying some theoretical ideas on which much network research draws. Next, we will study individual or “egocentric” networks, group-level networks, and networks that link individuals to groups or other entities.&nbsp; Substantively, the seminar will cover diverse fields of sociology:&nbsp; possibilities include community and social support, crime and delinquency, social movements, behavior in and around organizations, education, the organization of science, new media and networks, migration, and the “small world” phenomenon, and more.&nbsp; [The particular fields will be selected before the beginning of the semester.&nbsp; They will be chosen to illustrate a variety of different approaches to studying networks.]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All junior tutorials in sociology seek to develop both substantive knowledge and research skills.

This course explores ongoing debates about the changing and durable characteristics of the modern family in America and worldwide. Course materials and lectures will introduce key historical trends and concepts in family sociology.

This tutorial explores the craft of ethnography through the theme of social movements. We will examine key ethnographies of social movements, using these as models for understanding and conducting ethnographic fieldwork and analysis. Drawing on each student's research interests, participants in this course will complete an independent research project on some aspect of social movements, employing ethnographic methods. Through in-class workshops, we will formulate research questions and practical research design. The goal of this course is to provide you with the opportunity to conduct original research and to better understand the insights and challenges of ethnographic fieldwork.</p>","year":2020},{"id":"32356","title":"\"Studying Up\": Privilege, Elite Education, and Inequality","termName":"Fall","termYear":2015,"subjectDescription":"Sociology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","subject":"SOCIOL","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Sociology","component":"Junior Tutorial","externalCourseId":160224,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Privilege is an understudied but important topic in educational and social science research.
