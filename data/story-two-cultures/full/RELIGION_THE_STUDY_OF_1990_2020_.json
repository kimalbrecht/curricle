Impassioned public debates surround the treatment of religion in museums, where research, education, and entertainment are displayed in revealing ways. This course asks how we learn and teach about religion in a plural society. As leisure time and access to ``other'' cultures grow, museums crystallize questions about the relationship of: art to religion, education to entertainment, object to community, self-representation to representation of the ``other.'' How do you reconcile the authority of social institutions with the ongoing creativity of living communities? What context best discloses the meaning of religious art: patronage, patrimony, property, or performance? Drawing on existing models and new proposals, students will develop defensible intellectual concepts and cultural content for a museum.

We will examine moral and religious histories of the global health movement alongside pressing contemporary questions such as, how do disease epidemics shape religious practice? How does religious belief shape the reception of biomedical technologies? We will consider examples from a range of contexts and traditions.

Women’s relationship with religion has been particularly fraught. We will examine early Christian and contemporaneous texts through different lenses, drawing upon: feminist biblical interpretation and hermeneutics, literary and legal theory, anthropology, historical-critical studies, theology, lesbian-feminist theory, transgender studies, rabbinics, and classics. We will give special attention to critical theories of religion in gender/feminist studies, emphasizing the plural possibilities, contestations, and instability of religious texts. We will introduce various resources for critically engaging constructions of sex/gender/sexuality of both “orthodox” and “heretical” materials in conversation with Greek, Roman, and Jewish materials. The aims are to promote analytic reading strategies that engage the constructed, contested, and multi-perspectival character of varied religious materials and to discuss both the limits and the possibilities that this material offers for imagining a more expansive sphere for human flourishing today.</p><p>This course is being offered through The Graduate Consortium of Women's Studies.&nbsp; The first class will be held September 7 and runs through December 7.

Later, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer drew from all of these authors in order to rethink his own ethics of political resistance to fascism.

Without the person, the theology is liable to distortion and misunderstanding, rootless ideas. This course focuses on Ramanuja (1017-1137), one of the greatest Hindu theologians. He belonged to south India’s Srivaisnava tradition, and has been for 1000 years its main inspiration in theology and practice. His nine works include philosophy and commentaries, instructions for insiders and debates with outsiders, ecstatic prayers, and even a manual of daily worship. What inspired his writings? What was his message to believers and non-believers? How might he change how we think of “theology” and “theologian” today, and challenge the customary practices of South Asian studies?

Beginning with the Quran and Hadith, we will discuss a wide range of discourses in which questions of the good, the right, and the cultivation of virtue have been addressed, including theology, law, philosophy, literary ethics (adab), and various strands of the Sufi tradition. Throughout the course we will pay close attention to ways in which conceptions of what is good are connected to accounts of the nature of reality and the sources of human knowledge, noting how ethical questions pervade Islamic systems of knowledge and practice.</p><p>Jointly offered with the Divinity School as HDS 3042.</p>","year":2018.5},{"id":"45178","title":"Writing Lives: Readings in Contemporary Muslim and Arab Autobioraphy: Seminar","termName":"Fall","termYear":2004,"subjectDescription":"Religion","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Religion, The Study of","subject":"RELIGION","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Religion, The Study of","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":120102,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>An exploratory seminar in contemporary autobiographical writings by Arabs and Muslims, reflecting on themes of religiousness and secularism, among others, We will read the following texts: Edward Said's <i>Out of Place</i>, Sara Suleri's <i>Meatless Days</i>, and Fatima Mernissi's <i>Dreams of Trespass</i>.

Such appeals present \" heterosexual marriage\" as something that is an unchanging institution and has simply always been so. Moreover, they neglect both the centrality of power relations to first century discussions of marriage and the ways in which these discussions survive in the present. Against this backdrop, the course will examine the understandings of marriage and household in the formation of Early Christian communities and consider their impact within contemporary discussions of violence against wo/men, same sex marriage, or global sexual slavery. To that end, we will ask how New* Testament traditions of obedience and subordination still shape our understandings not only of community and church, but also marriage and other human relationships. At the same time we will also explore traditions of equality, mutuality and love also inscribed in New* Testament texts.</p> \t\t \t  <p>&nbsp;</p>","year":2015.5},{"id":"107298","title":"Sacrifice: Christian Theology, Discourse & Practice in Landscape of Ancient Mediterranean Religion","termName":"Fall","termYear":2012,"subjectDescription":"Religion","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Religion, The Study of","subject":"RELIGION","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Religion, The Study of","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":108150,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>This course will critically examine ancient Christian attitudes, rhetorics, and ritual practices in light of the wider Mediterranean religious landscape, focusing on the theologies-ideologies, discourses, and practices of sacrifice.

The Yogācāra school is often described as Buddhist idealism. More recent scholarly reassessment has also seen important strands of phenomenological investigation in Yogācāra.&nbsp; The Yogācāra literature is large and complex, and probably includes texts that fit on both sides of this divide. Yogācāra philosophers also contribute to the philosophy of mind, epistemology and the philosophy of language, and much if this work is independent of questions about idealism.&nbsp; Our goal will be to limn the contours of this school and to ask what insights are relevant to contemporary philosophical problems on the one hand, and to Buddhist philosophy more broadly on the other. We will read texts by and about Vasubandhu, Asaṅga, Sthiramāti and Dignāga in India, as well as some Tibetan texts that take up these themes and some recent scholarship addressing this material.

By taking a non-regional approach to the conceptualization of African diaspora religions we will explore how religion has been a key lens into the historical racializing, gendering and sexualizing of Black subjects, as well as a crucial aspect of revisionist and critical anthropology. We will read contemporary ethnographic works on the African Diaspora exploring the gendered and erotic production of \"Blackness.\" Through revisionist approaches, we will explore methodological and theoretical concerns to conducting ethnography of Afro-Atlantic religions. Students will be expected to interrogate issues of modernity, tradition, ritual and secularism and examine post-colonial, transnational feminist and cultural theories of the subject.

Yet they are also figures in very different cultures, histories, social and intellectual contexts. What have been their positions in their faith traditions? Who do the faithful believe them to be? How are they similar and different? Can they be beneficially understood by those who do not believe in them? Course readings will deal with great scriptural texts, worship practices, devotions, images, and their destinies as universal figures. Larger questions related to the nature of God, of religions, and of theology itself will be raised. The course proceeds by key readings, discussed vigorously in class.
