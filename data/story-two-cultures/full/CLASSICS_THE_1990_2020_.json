Despite extensive destruction, increasing numbers of bronze statues and fragments continue to come to light. This seminar will serve to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to the aesthetic, historic, and technological problems posed by surviving classical bronze sculpture. The seminar will take place in conjunction with the exhibition, \"The Fires of Hephaistos: Greek and Roman Monumental Bronze Sculpture in North American Collections,\" that will take place at the Sackler Museum, April - August 1996.</p>","year":1996},{"id":"156554","title":"Ancient Landscapes","termName":"Spring","termYear":2009,"subjectDescription":"Classical Archaeology","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","subject":"CLASARCH","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","component":"Lecture","externalCourseId":116728,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>In search of ancient Mediterranean landscapes, we range from city to countryside, and from garden grottoes to sacred mountains.

The seminar will be discussion-based, and texts, objects, and ideas will be brought into dialogue around themes that are arranged roughly chronologically. These will include&nbsp;the formation and identity of the Macedonian kingdom,&nbsp;interactions&nbsp;with Balkan and Asian neighbors, conflicts with Greek poleis, imperial expansion and consolidation,&nbsp;provincialization by Rome, and the dynamics of early Christian community building.&nbsp; Our enquiry will be conducted on several different scales: we will be informed both by close reading of texts and close examination of individual sites and objects, by the different, broader modern arguments into which texts, sites and objects are drawn, and by the big, overarching questions that we will ask as we move across time and place.

In each session, we consider one aspect of power (political, social, economic, environmental, or physical) and begin with an ancient text. An article employing a more traditional philological or historical approach to that evidence then follows. From this foundation, we will move to methods used in the social and pure sciences to study the same aspect of power. Methods studied derive from anthropology, (osteo)archaeology, botany, chemistry, demography, economic theory, genetics, geography, mathematics, medicine, political science, sociology, and statistics. Each class session will ask not only how these derived methods benefit (or fail to benefit) our study of ancient history but also, where applicable, the ways in which these studies integrate textual and material cultures to produce historical analysis.</p>","year":2017.5},{"id":"355100","title":"Greek Language: Koine to 20th Century Demotic","termName":"Spring","termYear":2011,"subjectDescription":"Classical Studies","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","subject":"CLS-STDY","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":127047,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p></p>","year":2011},{"id":"317261","title":"Alexander the Great and His Legacy: Hellenistic Kingship","termName":"Spring","termYear":2015,"subjectDescription":"Classical Studies","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","subject":"CLS-STDY","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":156098,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p></p>","year":2015},{"id":"175850","title":"Greek Language: From Koine to 20th Century Demotic","termName":"Spring","termYear":2011,"subjectDescription":"Classical Studies","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","subject":"CLS-STDY","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Classics, The","component":"Seminar","externalCourseId":127048,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Explores the development of the Greek language from the late third century BC to the early twentieth century.

Through engagement in narrative analysis and interpretation students will also be encouraged to whet their critical reading and writing skills.
