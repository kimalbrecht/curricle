In this part of the course we will practice a range of approaches to reading poems, considering a poem’s form alongside its cultural function, surveying the diverse and changing media and formats in which poems circulate--manuscript, performance, print, aural recording, performance;&nbsp; individual volume,&nbsp; general circulation magazine or newspaper,&nbsp; literary quarterly,&nbsp; schoolbook, gift book, psalter and more.&nbsp; Excursions may include visits to First Parish or Memorial Church, to Mt Auburn Cemetery and the Washington’s Headquarters and the Longfellow House. In the second 2/3 of the course we will focus on 20th century Harvard and its writers , with particular attention to 4 Harvard inflected moments in American literary history—the emergence of Modernism (&nbsp; with attention to Robinson, Du Bois, Frost,&nbsp; Reed,&nbsp; Stevens, Cullen); the rise of the&nbsp; New Criticism in the 1950’s&nbsp; (its standard bearers Eliot and Lowell ); the critique of New Criticism and rise of counter movements, New York School, Black Mountain, Beat Language,&nbsp; L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (from O’Hara, Ashbery, Koch, Creeley to Hejinian, Bernstein, Howe ) ; and, finally, Harvard and Radcliffe’s role in fostering poets from Gertrude Stein, Elizabeth Bishop&nbsp; through June Jordan and Adrienne Rich. Our 20th century studies will take us to the Woodberry Poetry Room, to Houghton and Schlesinger libraries, and students in the seminar will make their own contribution to Harvard's long poetic tradition by filming individual and group readings and interpretations of American poems for inclusion in the Poetry in America MOOC and other online outlets.</p>","year":2016.5},{"id":"164977","title":"The World of William James: Conference Course","termName":"Spring","termYear":2007,"subjectDescription":"History","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"History","subject":"HIST","classAcademicOrgDescription":"History","component":"Conference Course","externalCourseId":117910,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p>Examines James's life and writings in relation to American and European thinkers such as his contemporaries Wilhelm Dilthey and Friedrich Nietzsche, his brother Henry James, his sister Alice James, and his students W.E.B.

It is a hands on investigation -- via directing, acting and dance assignments -- of the myriad ways that heightened movement draws out aspects of texts, which cannot be approached via Realism or Naturalism. (No prior dance training required). The content to be explored will include texts by John Cage, Gertrude Stein, Anton Chekhov, Tristan Tzara as well as “found material” derived from literature, documentary film, critical writing and daily conversation. The emphasis of the course will be on practice but there will be a research component as well.</p><p>The research component will entail a detailed investigation of the avant-garde theatre movement in post World War II America. The course will combine theory and practice, as students will experience the interplay of historical research and contemporary practice.</p><p>This course will be taught by TDM Visiting Lecturer Paul Lazar.</p>","year":2018}]
