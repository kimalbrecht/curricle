In the work of W.B. Yeats, we will see major changes in his conception of love, as well as his views of Irish nationalism and the Irish revolution. Meanwhile, in T.S.

Elizabeth Bishop introduces a highly original voice that expresses personal emotions obliquely and, in effect, “objectively” through understated descriptions of events and places. Finally, W.H.

The centre of that disk is a dark purplish-brown color, while the edge is much lighter, almost white and transparent. This disk is constantly heaving and falling, at regular intervals; the margin is especially active, so much so, that, at times, it is stretched on a level with the whole surface of the disk, which, in such a condition, is almost flat, while, at other times, it is so fully arched that it assumes the appearance of a hemisphere...’</i>  --Louis Agassiz, Contributions to the Natural History of the United States (1862)</p> <p>  In recent studios we explored various aspects of the visual representation of the American Landscape. This year’s studio will extend our research into the expanding knowledge and emerging theories derived by both naturalists and fine artists discovering the New World of Americas. We will explore - from the macro to the micro, from the comprehensive to the incisive - notions of how to collect, map, dissect, examine, describe, classify and display. As Coleridge observed: all men are born Aristotelians or Platonists. The Platonist feel that classes, orders, and genres are realities; the Aristotelians, that they are generalizations. For the latter, language is nothing but an approximate set of symbols; for the former, it is the map of the universe. The Platonist knows that the universe is somehow a cosmos, an order; that order, for the Aristotelian, can be an error or a fiction of our partial knowledge.(1)</p> <p>During this year studio we will explore the rare archives, hidden collections and lost treasures at Harvard University in search for inspiration to create a new ‘Museum of Curiosity’, which displays and debates the promiscuous discourse between the dialectic worlds of fine arts and the natural sciences. The Museum - which may be anything but a building and rather a Garden of Earthly Delights - will be situated and narrated in a re-wildered and rejuvenated Emerald Necklace, Boston.</p> <p>We invite students to enter the world of strange beauty and enlightened imagination; the butterfly collection of Nabokov, the dissected specimen of Agassiz, the herbarium of Thoreau and to examine the various insights provided by the remarkable track record of the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship in Poetry held by illustrious figures such as T.S. Eliot, Jorge Luis Borges, Buckminster Fuller, John Cage .....Students will be stimulated to behave like hyperactive squirrels who will collect and dissect and become unscrupulous tomb raiders, high brow curators and, above all, imaginative designers which will create and give shape.</p> <p>We start our studio expedition by examining the description of the Naked Eye Medusae (Cyanea Artica) by the Swiss born Harvard University naturalist Louis Agassiz and published in his 1862 book Contributions to the Natural History of the United States. The modernist poet Erza Pound was greatly impressed by Agassiz methodical and thorough prose descriptions and the fact that Louis Agassiz had a reputation for locking up students in an isolated room for weeks in row with the simple task to meticulous describe a slowly disintegrating sunfish. (Obvious Agassiz was not a Platonist. Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced, reducing the specimen to its constituent parts. All knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole).</p> <p>As part of the studio submission students will be asked to create their own (virtual) cabinet of curiosities.</p>","year":2015.5},{"id":"215496","title":"Rosario Territorial Front","termName":"Fall","termYear":2011,"subjectDescription":"Studio","subjectAcademicOrgDescription":"Architecture","subject":"STU","classAcademicOrgDescription":"Landscape Architecture","component":"Studio","externalCourseId":200766,"courseDescriptionLong":"<p><i>This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper. T.S. Eliot, \"The Hollow Men\" (1925)</i>  Latin-American cities, especially those of Indian Laws foundation, do not end but dissolve. Starting from a consolidated urban void, the never-ending grid spreads the increasingly low-density urban tissue until it fades away into the rural. In the Argentinean Pampa's, the flat abstract landscape accentuates this impression of dissolution. Jorge Luis Borges spoke of the horizontal vertigo the open field, that is the landscape that enters the city bringing fragments of horizon to the linear perspectives of our long streets. It is not that the city dissolves into the Pampas; it is that the Pampas enters the city, on empty lots, on urban gardens, on interstitial parks. The westward urban border of the city of Rosario, Argentina provides one the best case studies for this condition. Bracketed by two small rivers marking the north and south limits of the city, the site for this studio has been newly defined by the Urban Plan Rosario 2007-2017 as the New Strategic Territorial Front. Full of complex conditions, the site offers a compelling laboratory for urban experimentation, and the chance to define new responsibilities regarding the new and varied scales at which we must operate today. We want to engage our practices with one of the most pressing issues facing contemporary designers: the relationship between natural environments and processes of urbanization. This studio will ground the projects in reality; our interventions will address the environmental, economic and social processes currently at play. The projects will acquire material, spatial and programmatic specificity, incorporating notions of regulations, remediation techniques, developmental demands, management tactics and construction technologies. This is our chance to influence the agenda of the next 20 years of metropolitan planning: by avoiding oppositions between environmental and infrastructural systems we will open new perspectives and take full responsibility in the intrinsic makeability of the urban.</p>","year":2011.5}]
